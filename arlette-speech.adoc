I would like to begin by thanking everyone for coming to this very special
occasion to celebrate the marriage of Huguette and Katlego. 
I would also like to thank everyone who has helped in the lead up to the wedding in
whatever way possible. 
A special thank you to those who have made long journeys to be here with us.

Dear Huguette, 

I believe it was a French author who said: "When children true love, parents find true joy."
I did not give birth to you, but you are my daughter nonetheless.
More than blood, we share so much since the days you came in my life. 
The years have flown by so fast. There have been ups and downs and breakdowns.
And while Iâ€™ll always cherish the past, I hope your future is filled with more smiles than frowns.

Here we are today helping you embark on the next journey, a life with a family
of your own. You may need one or two advices.

First and foremost, tell your husband how much you love him, as often as you can. Every morning, and every night.
Appreciate him for the man he is and the man he will became.
Have fun together, find new and exciting ways to experience life.
Set goals that you both want.
May your husband be your shade from the sun, warm drink on a cold day, and a rainbow after the storm.

Secondly, marriage is not a fairy tale.    
Fairy tales always ends up by they live happily ever after.
In real life, Prince Charming may snore and the Princess must do the dishes.
Remember that "A great marriage is not when the perfect couple come together. 
It is when an imperfect couple learns to enjoy their differences."
Things can be very though and to survive, you have to learn to forgive and to say I am sorry. 
Not because you are weak, but because you are strong.
Not because you are blind, but because you chose to see the bright side of every situation.

Dear Katlego, 
You are now my son. You are part of the family. 
Love constantly, accuse lowly, forgive quickly and share everything -even the housework. 
Be each other's best friend.
Be the president of Huguette's fan club. Be her BFF. 
Be real, be yourself, be unique, be true, be honest, be humble, be happy.

So today, your friends and family surround you as you begin something new and
marvelous. Remember promises, keep them with all your heart, and you will have
that sense of joy and wonder that exceeds all you have heretofore known.  May
God bless your union and give you , Hughette and Katlego, every happiness
possible and long and joyful life  together as husband and wife.
