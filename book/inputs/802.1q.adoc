= IEEE 802.1Q 

== Definition

- Tags frames on a trunk 
** Inserts a 4-byte tag into the original frame between the Source Address and the Type/Length field
** Recomputes the frame check sequence (FCS) before the device sends the frame over the trunk link. 
** Removes the tag at the receiving end

- Does not tag frames on the native VLAN. 
** Must use the same native VLAN on both sides of the trunk
** Default to VLAN 1 

- Supports up to 4096 VLANs 
** Defines a single instance of spanning tree that runs on the native VLAN for all the VLANs in the network. 
** lacks the flexibility and load balancing capability of PVST that is available with ISL.
** PVST+ offers the capability to retain multiple spanning tree topologies with 802.1Q trunking.

Priority::

- 3 bits
- Called also user priority or IEEE 802.p
- Indicates the frame priority level
- Can be used to prioritize the traffic

CFI—Canonical Format Indicator::
- 1 bit
- Value: 0 if MAC address is in canonical format otherwise 1

VID—VLAN Identifier::
- 12 bits
- Identifies the VLAN to which the frame belongs
