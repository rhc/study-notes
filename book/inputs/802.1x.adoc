== Definition

- Port-based authentication

- until the client is authenticated,
 allows only EAPoL (Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN), CDP and STP traffic


- supplicant: client driver that supplies username/password prompt to the user and sends/receives the EAPoL messages 
- authenticator: edge switch or wireless access point, translates between EAPoL and RADIUS and enables/disables ports based on the authentication success/failure
- authentication server: performs the actual authentication (Radius with EAP)

  DOT1X-SP-5-SECURITY_VIOLATION: Security violation on interface GigabitEthernet4/8,
  New MAC address 0080.ad00.c2e4 is seen on the interface in Single host mode
  %PM-SP-4-ERR_DISABLE: security-violation error detected on Gi4/8, putting Gi4/8 in
  err-disable state

This message indicates that the port on the specified interface is configured in single-host mode.
Any new host that is detected on the interface is treated as a security violation.
The port has been error disabled.
Ensure that only one host is connected to the port.
If you need to connect to an IP phone and a host behind it, configure Multidomain Authentication Mode on that switchport.

The Multidomain authentication (MDA) mode allows an IP phone and a single host behind the IP phone to authenticate independently,
with 802.1X, MAC authentication bypass (MAB), or (for the host only) web-based authentication.
In this application, Multidomain refers to two domains — data and voice — and only two MAC addresses are allowed per port.
The switch can place the host in the data VLAN and the IP phone in the voice VLAN, though they appear to be on the same switch port.
The data VLAN assignment can be obtained from the vendor-specific attributes (VSAs) received from the AAA server within authentication.
