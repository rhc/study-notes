== Proxy ARP

- Same message as ARP
- Allows response for IP address in remote subnet.
- RFC 1027
- Mostly replaced by DHCP nowadays

[TIP]
====
High CPU utilization in the ARP input process occurs if the router has to originate an excessive
number of ARP requests. The router uses ARP for all hosts, not just those on the local subnet,
and ARP requests are sent out as broadcasts, which causes more CPU utilization on every host
in the network. ARP requests for the same IP address are rate-limited to one request every two
seconds, so an excessive number of ARP requests would have to originate for different IP
addresses. This can happen if an IP route has been configured pointing to a broadcast interface
(as opposed to next-hop). A most common example is a default route such as:

  ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 Fastethernet0/0

In this case, the router generates an ARP request for each IP address that is not reachable
through more specific routes, which practically means that the router generates an ARP request
for almost every address on the Internet.
====


IMPORTANT: When the router needs to route a packet which matches an entry in the routing
  table with a next-hop value, it performs Layer 3 to Layer 2 resolution for the
  next-hop address. If it matches an entry in the routing table with just the
  outgoing/exit local interface, without a next-hop value, it performs Layer 3 to
  Layer 2 resolution for the final destination of the IP packet.

== Gratuitous ARP

- broadcast ARP messages where the SPA=TPA and THA=FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF

** to detect IP address conflit
** to update other machine ARP table
** to update mac table of the connected switche

TIP: If we see multiple gratitous ARPs from the same host frequently,
it can be an indication of bad Ethernet NICs


== RARP and BootP As DHCP Precursors

image::rarp-bootp.png[RARP and BootP before DHCP]

- A RARP request is a host's attempt to find its own IP address. So RARP uses the
  same old ARP message, but the ARP request lists a MAC address target of its own
  MAC address and a target IP address of 0.0.0.0. A preconfigured RARP server,
  which must be on the same subnet as the client, receives the request and
  performs a table lookup in its configuration. If that target MAC address listed
  in the ARP request is configured on the RARP server, the RARP server sends an
  ARP reply, after entering the configured IP address in the Source IP address
  field.


- BOOTP was defined in part to improve IP address assignment features of RARP.
  BOOTP uses a completely different set of messages, defined by RFC 951, with the
  commands encapsulated inside an IP and UDP header. With the correct router
  configuration, a router can forward the BOOTP packets to other subnetsâ€”allowing
  the deployment of a centrally located BOOTP server. Also, BOOTP supports the
  assignment of many other tidbits of information, including the subnet mask,
  default gateway, DNS addresses, and its namesake, the IP address of a boot (or
  image) server. However, BOOTP does not solve the configuration burden of RARP,
  still requiring that the server be preconfigured with the MAC addresses and IP
  addresses of each client.


== ARP vulnerabilities

1. Since ARP does not authenticate requests or replies, ARP Requests and Replies can be forged
2. ARP is stateless: ARP Replies can be sent without a corresponding ARP Request
3. According to the ARP protocol specification, a node receiving an ARP
packet (Request or Reply) must update its local ARP cache with the
information in the source fields, if the receiving node already has an entry
for the IP address of the source in its ARP cache.

Typical exploitation of these vulnerabilities:

- ARP poisoning: a  forged ARP Request or Reply can be used to update the ARP cache of
a remote system with a forged entry
- This can be used to redirect IP traffic to other hosts
