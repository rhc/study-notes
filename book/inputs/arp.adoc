== Proxy ARP

- Same message as ARP
- Allows response for IP address in remote subnet.
- RFC 1027
- Mostly replaced by DHCP nowadays

== Gratuitous ARP

- broadcast ARP messages where the SPA=TPA and THA=FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF

- used to

** to detect IP address conflit
** to update other machine ARP table
** to update mac table of the connected switche

TIP: If we see multiple gratitous ARPs from the same host frequently,
it can be an indication of bad Ethernet NICs


== RARP and BootP As DHCP Precursors

image::rarp-bootp.png[RARP and BootP before DHCP]

- A RARP request is a host’s attempt to find its own IP address. So RARP uses the
  same old ARP message, but the ARP request lists a MAC address target of its own
  MAC address and a target IP address of 0.0.0.0. A preconfigured RARP server,
  which must be on the same subnet as the client, receives the request and
  performs a table lookup in its configuration. If that target MAC address listed
  in the ARP request is configured on the RARP server, the RARP server sends an
  ARP reply, after entering the configured IP address in the Source IP address
  field.


- BOOTP was defined in part to improve IP address assignment features of RARP.
  BOOTP uses a completely different set of messages, defined by RFC 951, with the
  commands encapsulated inside an IP and UDP header. With the correct router
  configuration, a router can forward the BOOTP packets to other subnets—allowing
  the deployment of a centrally located BOOTP server. Also, BOOTP supports the
  assignment of many other tidbits of information, including the subnet mask,
  default gateway, DNS addresses, and its namesake, the IP address of a boot (or
  image) server. However, BOOTP does not solve the configuration burden of RARP,
  still requiring that the server be preconfigured with the MAC addresses and IP
  addresses of each client.
