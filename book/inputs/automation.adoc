== agent-based automation tools

=== Puppet

- Puppet master, agent
- Ruby
- TCP connections
- installation types:
  * monolithic: < 4000 nodes
  * monolithic with compile masters: 4000 ... 20000 nodes
  * monolithic with compile masters and standalone PE-PostgreSQL: > 20000 nodes
- community https://forge.puppet.com

- Puppet modules
  * manifests: configures the clients running the puppet agents
    ** pushed to the devices using SSL and certificates
    ** .pp extension
  * templates
  * files

.Puppet NTP_Server.pp Manifest
----
ntp_server { '1.2.3.4':
  ensure => 'present',
  key => 94,
  prefer => true,
  minpoll => 4,
  maxpoll => 14,
  source_interface => 'Vlan 42',

}
----

.Puppet MOTD.pp Manifest
----
banner { 'default':
  motd => 'Violators will be prosecuted',
}
----

=== Chef

- Ruby, Erlang
- push, pull model
- Chef server deployments:
  * Chef Solo: hosted locally on the workstation
  * Chef Client and Server:
  * Hosted chef: in the cloud
  * Private Chef: on-prem

.Puppet vs Chef
|===
|Chef components | Puppet components | server/master functions

| chef server | puppet master | server/master functions
| chef client | Puppet agent | client/agent functions
| cookbook | module | collection of code or files
| recipe | manifest | code
| workstation | console | where users interact with configuration management tool and create code
|===

- upload cookbooks to server with *knife upload <cookbook-name>*
- OHAI service on the nodes
- tests recipes and cookbooks in the kitchen prior to production
- supports minitest, RSpec, Serverspec, BATS(bash automated testing system)


=== SaltStack (Agent and Server mode)

- Python
- Salt formulas
- masters and minions
- runs remote commands in parallel
- event-driven technology
  * reactors: on the masters,
  * beacons: on the minions
- pillars and grains
- DSL with targets, commands, arguments

== agentless-based automation tools

=== Ansible

- Python
- agentless
- connects with SSH or WinRM (Windows Remote Management)
- PPDIOO (Prepare, Plan, Design, Implement, Observe, Optimize)
- components:
  * playbooks: set of plays for remote systems written in YAML
  * play: set of tasks applied to a group of hosts
  * task: call to Ansible module
- CLI commands
  * ansible: runs modules against targets
  * ansible-playbook: runs playbooks
  * ansible-docs: documents parameters in the CLI
  * ansible-pull: changes clients from default push model to pull model
  * ansible-vault: encrypts YAML files that contain sensitive data

=== Puppet Bolt

- orchestrator-driven tasks: for large-scale environments
- standalone tasks: connects directly to devices.

- runs *bolt command run <command-name> <devices>*
- runs *bold script <script-name>*
- operations:
  * copies the script into a temporary directory on the remote device
  * executes the script
  * captures the results
  * removes the script from the remote system
- task naming convention: <modulename>::<taskfilename>

=== SaltStack SSH (Server-only mode)

- needs SSH and Python installed on the client
- slower than the 0MQ distributed messaging library
