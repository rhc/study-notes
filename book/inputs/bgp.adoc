Active:: attempts to initiate a TCP connection with the remote
peer. If successful, sends OPEN message. If not, resets ConnectRetry timer and transitions back to Connect state
OpenSent:: TCP connection up and OPEN message sent,  transition to OpenReceive state and wait for initial
keepalive to move into OpenConfirm state.  If TCP session disconnect, terminate BGP session, reset ConnectRetry timer, move back to Active State.
OpenConfirm:: OPEN messages sent and received. Wait for KEEPALIVE
Established:: KEEPALIVE received, neighbor parameters match. the BGP peer session is fully established. UPDATE messages containing routing information will now be sent.

== Autonomous Systems

- AS: set of routers under a single technical administration
- AS can be:
  * stub : only one exit
  * multihomed: multiple connections with the one or multiple providers
    ** transit: allows traffic with origin and destination outside the AS
    ** non-transit:

=== ASN Format

- 2-byte (RFC 4271)
  * 0 - 65535
  * reserved: 0, 65535
  * public use: 1 - 64495
  * documentation: 64496-64511 (RFC 5398)
  * private use: 64512 - 65534

== BGP Peers

- Manually configured and not automatically discovered
- Formed over a TCP connection
- Exchanges PA(Path Attributes) and NLRI (IP/prefix) with the same PA
- Starts with full BGP routing table then incremental updates
- Keeps table version number

iBPG peers ::
  - same AS
  - must be fully meshed within AS

eBGP peers ::
  - different AS
  - by default, one hop away but you can change that with *ebgp-multihop*

.Task: Configure Neighbor
----

== BGP Peer Groups

- Group of peers with the same update policies ( outbound route maps, distribute lists, filter lists, update source ,)
- Benefits:
  * simplify configuration
  * make configuration updates more efficient

- Restrictions for eBGP peers:

.Task: Create a BGP Peer Group
----
(config-router)# neighbor <peer-group-name> peer-group
----

.Task: Assign a Neighbor to a Peer Group
----
(config-router)# neighbor <ip-address> peer-group <name>
----

.Task: Add a Text Description with a Specified Peer Group
----
(config-router)# neighbor <peer-group-name> description <text>
----

.Task: Disable a BGP Peer or Peer Group
----
(config-router)# neighbor <ip-address> shutdown
----

== BGP Session Reset

- Whenever the routing policy changes due to a configuration change
- Can be hard reset, soft reset or dynamic inbound soft reset

.Task: Clear and Reset BGP Neighbor Sessions
----
# clear ip bgp *
----

.Task: Enable Logging Of BGP Neighbor Resets
----
(config-router)# bgp log-neighbor-changes
----

.Task: Clear BGP Update Group Membership and Recalculate BGP Update Groups
----
# clear ip bgp update-group [ <index-group> | <ip-address> ]
----

=== Hard Reset

- Tears down the peering sessions including the TCP connections
- Deletes prefixes learned from the peers.
- Pros: no memory overhead

=== Soft Reset

- Stores prefix information
- Do not tearn down existing peering sessions
- Can be configured for inbound or outbound sessions

.Task:Configure a BGP Speaker to Perform Inbound Soft Reconfiguration for Peers That Do Not Support the Route Refresh Capability.
----
(config-router)# bgp soft-reconfig-backup
----

.Task: Start Storing Updates for Each Neighbor That Do Not Support Route Refresh
----
(config-router)# neighbor <ip-address|peer-group-name> soft-reconfiguration [inbound]
----
[NOTE]
====
- All the updates received from this neighbor will be stored unmodified,
  regardless of the inbound policy. When inbound soft reconfiguration is done
  later, the stored information will be used to generate a new set of inbound
  updates.

- Memory requirements can increased.
====

=== Dynamic Inbound Soft Reset

- Do not store update information locally
- Relies on dynamic exchanges with supporting peers
- The peers supports the capability if  *show ip bgp neighbors* displays
  _Received route refresh capability from peer_ .
- Use *bgp soft-reconfig-backup* to store updates for peers who do not support the refresh route capability

=== Routing Policy Change Management

TODO: add this part under bgp reset

== BGP Route Aggregation

- 2 methods
  * basic route redistribution: creates an aggregate route, then redistributes the routes in BGP
  * conditional aggregation: creates an aggregate route , then advertises or not certain routes
  based on route maps, AS-SET, or summary information

- *bgp suppress-inactive* stops BGP to advertise inactive routes (not installed
  into the RIB) to any peer.


=== BGP Route Aggregation Generating AS_SET Information

#TODO: improve this part

AS_SET information can be generated when BGP routes are aggregated using the
aggregate-address command. The path advertised for such a route is an AS_SET
consisting of all the elements, including the communities, contained in all the
paths that are being summarized. If the AS_PATHs to be aggregated are
identical, only the AS_PATH is advertised. The ATOMIC-AGGREGATE attribute, set
by default for the aggregate-address command, is not added to the AS_SET.




== BGP Backdoor Routes

- Use *network backdoor* to cause BGP to prefer EIGRP

== Best Path Selection Algorithm

. Reachable Next Hop (Well-Known Mandatory)
. Highest Weight
. Highest Local Pref
. Locally Originated Paths (Network, Distribute, Aggregate-Summary) Over Externally Originated Paths
. Shortest AS Path
. Lowest Origin Type ( Internal Over External Over Incomplete)
. Lowest MED
. EBGP Paths Over IBGP Paths
. Lowest IGP Cost
. Oldest Path
. Lowest BGP Router Id

TIP: “We Love Oranges AS Oranges Mean Pure Refreshment”.
W Weight (Highest) L Local_Pref (Highest) O Originate (local originate) AS
As_Path (shortest) O Origin Code (IGP < EGP < Incomplete) M MED (lowest) P
Paths (External Paths preferred Over Internal) R Router ID (lowest)

TIP: wise lip lovers apply oral medication every night

== Community Attributes

- No-advertise: prevents advertisements to any BGP peer
- No-export: prevents advertisements to any eBGP peer
- local-as:  prevents advertisements outside the AS, or in confederation scenarios, outside the sub-AS
- Internet:  advertises routes to any peer

- Conditionally advertise BGP routes

The routes or prefixes that will be conditionally advertised are defined in two
route maps: an advertise map and either an exist map or nonexist map. The route
map associated with the exist map or nonexist map specifies the prefix that the
BGP speaker will track. The route map associated with the advertise map
specifies the prefix that will be advertised to the specified neighbor when the
condition is met.

- If a prefix is found to be present in the exist map by the BGP speaker, the
  prefix specified by the advertise map is advertised.

- If a prefix is found not to be present in the nonexist map by the BGP
  speaker, the prefix specified by the advertise map is advertised.

- If the condition is not met, the route is withdrawn and conditional
  advertisement does not occur. All routes that may be dynamically advertised
  or not advertised must exist in the BGP routing table in order for
  conditional advertisement to occur. These routes are referenced from an
  access list or an IP prefix list.

== BGP PIC

- BGP Prefix-Independent Convergence for IP and MPLS-VPN feature
- creates and stores a backup/alternate path in the RIB,FIB, and CEF
  so that when a failure is detected, the backup/alternate path can immediately take over,
  thus enabling fast failover.


[sidebar, float="right"]
.How BGP Converges Under Normal Circumstances
--
Under normal circumstances, BGP can take several seconds to a few minutes to converge after a network change. At a high level, BGP goes through the following process:

- BGP learns of failures through either IGP or BFD events or interface events.
- BGP withdraws the routes from the RIB, and the RIB withdraws the routes from the FIB and dFIB.  This process clears the data path for the affected prefixes.
- BGP sends withdraw messages to its neighbors.
- BGP calculates the next best path to the affected prefixes.
- BGP inserts the next best path for affected prefixes into the RIB, and the RIB installs them in the FIB and dFIB.

This process takes a few seconds or a few minutes to complete, depending on the
latency of the network, the convergence time across the network, and the local
load on the devices. The data plane converges only after the control plane converges.
--

TIP: When BGP PIC is enabled, CEF recursion is disabled
when next-hop is learned via /32 mask or next-hop is directly connected

== BGP TTL Security Check

TTL Security Check is a security feature that protects BGP peers from multi-hop
attacks. This feature is based on the Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM,
RFC 3682), and is currently available for BGP. Work is currently in progress to
implement this feature for other routing protocols such as OSPF and EIGRP.

TTL Security Check allows the configuration of a minimum acceptable TTL value
for the packets exchanged between two eBGP peers. When enabled, both peering
routers transmit all their traffic to each other with a TTL of 255. In
addition, routers establish a peering session only if the other eBGP peer sends
packets with a TTL equal to or greater than the TTL value configured for the
peering session. All packets received with TTL values less than the predefined
value are silently discarded.
