= CGMP

- Cisco proprietary
- Layer 2 protocol, well-known MAC 0X0100.0CDD.DDDD
- configured on both the cisco router and switch.
- permits routers to communicate L2 info it has learned from IGMP to switches
- Only routers send CGMP messages while switches only listens to CGMP messages
- helps switches send group traffic to only those hosts that want it -> no wasted bandwidth


== Understanding

CGMP is a protocol used on Cisco routers and multilayer switches connected to
Layer 2 Catalyst switches to perform tasks similar to those performed by IGMP.
CGMP permits Layer 2 group membership information to be communicated from the
CGMP server to the switch, which can learn on which ports multicast members
reside instead of flooding multicast traffic to all switch ports. 

IGMP snooping is another method to constrain the flooding of multicast packets.


=== Joining a Group with CGMP

Hosts connected to a Layer 2 Catalyst switch can join a multicast group by
sending an unsolicited IGMP membership report message to the target group
(224.1.2.3) as shown in Figure 33-7. Because LAN switches operate at Layer 2
and understand only MAC addresses, the source and destination fields of the
frame contain 48-bit MAC addresses for Host 3 (0080.c7a2.1093) and MAC-address
equivalent of the multicast group address (0100.5e01.0203).

The IGMP membership report is received by the Layer 2 switch and forwarded to
the CGMP server for normal IGMP processing. The CGMP server, which must have
CGMP enabled on the interface connected to the Layer 2 switch, receives the
membership report and translates the report into a CGMP join message. It sends
the CGMP join message to the switch through the well-known CGMP multicast MAC
address (0x0100.0cdd.dddd). When the Layer 2 switch receives the join message,
it updates its forwarding table to include the MAC-equivalent of the group
destination address and the applicable input and output switch ports.

=== Leaving a Group with CGMP

When an IGMPv2 host leaves a group, it can send an IGMP leave group message to
the all-multicast-routers group (224.0.0.2). The CGMP server translates this
leave group message into a CGMP leave message and sends it to the switch.

To expedite a host on a LAN leaving a multicast group, some Layer 2 Catalyst
switch software offers the CGMP Fast-Leave feature, which allows the switch to
perform IGMPv2 leave processing locally without involving the CGMP server and
accelerates the removal of unused CGMP groups. The host sends the leave group
message to the all-multicast-routers group (224.0.0.2). The Layer 2 switch
processes it and does not forward it to the CGMP server. The Layer 2 switch
sends an IGMP general query message on the port where the leave message was
received to determine if there are remaining members for the group on the port.
If no response is received, the Layer 2 switch sends an IGMP leave message to
the CGMP server, which sends a group-specific query to the multicast group to
see if there are any remaining members in the group. If there is no response,
the CGMP server updates its multicast routing table and sends a CGMP delete
group message to the Layer 2 switch, which updates its routing table.

=== Process

1. When a CGMP-capable router gets connected to the switch, it sends a CGMP Join
message with the GDA set to 0 and the USA set to its own MAC address.
The CGMP-capable switch now knows that a multicast router is connected to the port
on which it received the router’s CGMP message. The router repeats the message
every 60 seconds. A router can also tell the switch that it no longer
participates in CGMP by sending a CGMP Leave message with the GDA set to 0 and
the USA set to its own MAC address.

2. When a host joins a group, it sends an IGMP Join message. Normally, a
multicast router examines only Layer 3 information in the IGMP Join message,
and the router does not have to process any Layer 2 information. However, when
CGMP is configured on a router, the router also examines the Layer 2
destination and source MAC addresses of the IGMP Join message. The source
address is the unicast MAC address of the host that sent the IGMP Join message.
The router then generates a CGMP Join message that includes the multicast MAC
address associated with the multicast IP address (to the GDA field of the CGMP
join) and the unicast MAC address of the host (to the USA field of the CGMP
message). The router sends the CGMP Join message using the well-known CGMP
multicast MAC address 0x0100.0cdd.dddd as the destination address.

3. When switches receive a CGMP Join message, they search in their CAM tables
for the port number associated with the host MAC address listed in the USA
field. Switches create a new CAM table entry (or use an existing entry if it
was already created before) for the multicast MAC address listed in the GDA
field of the CGMP Join message, add the port number associated with the host
MAC address listed in the USA field to the entry, and forward the group traffic
on the port.

4. When a host leaves a group, it sends an IGMP Leave message. The router
learns the host’s unicast MAC address (USA) and the IP multicast group it has
just left. Because the Leave messages are sent to the All Multicast Routers MAC
address 0x0100.5e00.0002 and not to the multicast group address the host has
just left, the router calculates the multicast MAC address (GDA) from the IP
multicast group the host has just left. The router then generates a CGMP Leave
message, copies the multicast MAC address it has just calculated in the GDA
field and unicast MAC address in the USA field of the CGMP Leave message, and
sends it to the well- known CGMP multicast MAC address.

5. When switches receive a CGMP Leave message, they again search for the port
number associated with the host MAC address listed in the USA field. Switches
remove this port from the CAM table entry for the multicast MAC address listed
in the GDA field of the CGMP Leave message and stop forwarding the group
traffic on the port.
