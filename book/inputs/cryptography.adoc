= cryptography

- secure data in-transit and at rest  
- confidentiality (encryption)
- integrity (hashing, digital signature)
- origin authentication (hashing, digital certificate)
- non-repudiation (digital signature)

== hashing

- hashing: one-way math fx, irreversible
  * from data of arbitrary
  * to specific size

- attacks:
* collusion (multiple inputs can produce the same output)
* inversion 

- security strength depends on both algorithm and the length

hmac 
keyed hash message authentication code 
- data + salt (shared with receiver) -> hash

== encryption


TODO read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography
TODO add graphviz diagram for public-private key, symmetric algo

- two-way math fx
* encrypt (plaintext , encryption key)  -> cyphertext
* decrypt ( cyphertext, decryption key ) -> plain text

===  symmetric algorithm

- same key for encryption and decryption
- cheap, fast
- key length varies between 512 and ??? 
- main use 
*  secure IPSec/SSL VPN traffic
* secure folders, hdd, application containers

- examples
  * DES (Data Encryption Standard): 64-bit key but only 56 used for encryption
  * 3DES (Triple DES): 168-bit key, uses 3 keys of 56bits 
  * AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): 3 versions (128, 192, 256) bits


===  asymmetric algorithm

- different key for encryption and decruption
- expensive, slow
- key length varies between 512 and 32768 bits ???
- commonly used 
  * RSA: Rivest Shamir Adleman
  * DSA: Digital Signature Algorithm
  * DH: Diffie Hellman Algorithm
  * ECC: Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECDH, ECDSA)

TODO read elliptic curves wikipedia pages

== PKI

- CA (certificate authority): trusted third-party that verifies, issues, revokes digital certificates
- Applicant:
- 
- Digital certificate: 
  * public-key certificate
  * electronic document to prove ownership of a public key
  * includes information about public key owner's identity
  * signed by the CA's private key

- main standards
  * pkcs#10: format of 
  * X.509: v3
    ** version and serial number
    ** subject name
    ** subject PK and PK algorithm
    ** validity period
    ** issuer name (CA)
    ** CA signature algorithm and CA signature

TODO read PKI standards


TODO redo this section

- PKI enrollment process
. CA generates a self-signed certificate
  .. private-public key pair
  .. identity information
  .. validity information (for the self-signed certificate and certificates issues to applicants) 
  .. signature algorithm
  .. CSR (identity information and PK)
. applicant
  .. receives CA's certificate in order to trust the CA
  .. generates a private-public key par

- PKI certification revocation
  * CRL: certificate revocation list 
  * OCSP: online certificate status protocol
    
- Digital certificates security functions
* origin authentication: 
* confidentiality
* integrity: 
* non-repudiation

=== digital signature

- uses hashing and asymmetric
- the signer computes a hash/fingerprint of the data
- the signer uses its private key to encrypt the hash
- the encrypted hash (signature) is attached to the data
- the verifier decrypt the signature with the signer's PK
- the verifier computes a hash of the data and compares it with the decrypted hash
