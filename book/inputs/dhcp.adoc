== DHCP Server

- Accepts address assignment requests and renewals from clients
- Assign address, name server, gateways, ...
- Accepts broadcasts from local clients or relay agents
- Database as a tree used for attribute inheritance
** Root: address pool for natural networks
** Branches: subnetwork address pools
** Leaves: manual bindings

.Task: Clear DHCP Server Variables
----
clear ip dhcp binding { <address> | * }
clear ip dhcp conflict { <address> | * }
clear ip dhcp server statistics
----

.Task: Troubleshoot DHCP IP Address Assignments, Lease Expirations, and Database Chnages
----
# debug ip dhcp server events
----

=== Database Agent

- Host (ftp, tftp, rcp) or storage that stores the DHCP bindings database.

.Task: Save Automatic Bindings on a Remote Host
----
ip dhcp database <url> [timeout <seconds>] [ write-dely <seconds>]
----

[NOTE]
=====
- *url*: can be ftp,tftp, rcp, flash, disk
- *timeout*: how long the DHCP server wait before aborting database transfer. default: 5 minutes
- *write-delay*: how soon the DHCP server should send database updates. default:  5 minutes, minimum: 60 seconds
=====

.Task: Run DHCP Server Without Database Agent
----
(config)# no ip dhcp conflict logging
----

[NOTE]
====
- Not recommended
- TODO: add the reason

=== Address Pool

- Specify which DHCP options to use for the client
** If the client is not directly connected to the DHCP server (the giaddr field of the DHCPDISCOVER broadcast message is nonzero), the server matches the DHCPDISCOVER with the DHCP pool that has the subnet that contains the IP address in the giaddr field.
** If the client is directly connected to the DHCP server (the giaddr field is zero), the DHCP server matches the DHCPDISCOVER with DHCP pools that contain the subnets configured on the receiving interface. If the interface has secondary IP addresses, subnets associated with the secondary IP addresses are examined for possible allocation only after the subnet associated with the primary IP address (on the interface) is exhausted.

- Dynamically maps hardware address to an IP address from a pool.
- Stored in volatile RAM and periodically copied to database agent

==== Manual Binding

* MAC address of hosts are found in the DHCP database
* Stored in NVRAM
* Can be configured
** Individually and stored in NVRAM
** In batch from text files

----
(dhcp-config)# host <address> [<mask>| </prefix-length]
----

.Task: Specify the Unique Identifier for a DHCP Client
----
(dhcp-config)# client-identifier <unique-identifier>
----

- Send with DHCP option 61
- Unique identifier
** 7-byte: 1byte for the media , 6 byte for the MAC address
** 27-byte: vendor, MAC address, source interface of the client

.Task: Determine the Client Identifier
----
# debug ip dhcp server packet

DHCPD:DHCPDISCOVER received from client 0b07.1134.a029 through relay 10.1.0.253.
DHCPD:assigned IP address 10.1.0.3 to client 0b07.1134.a029.
----

.Task:
----
(dhcp-config)# hardware-address <hw-address> [<protocol-type> | <hw-number>]
----

- For client who can not send a client identifier in the packet

.Task:
----
(dhcp-config)# client-name <name>
----

- Do not include the domain name


=== Static Mapping

- From customer-created text file that DHCP server reads at boot
* Short configuration: no need for several numerous host pools with manual bindings
* Reduce space required in NVRAM to maintain address pools

- The file format has the following elements:
** Database version number
** End-of-file designator
** Hardware type
** Hardware address
** IP address
** Lease expiration
** Time the file was created

.Example
----
*time* Jan 21 2005 03:52 PM
*version* 2
!IP address    Type    Hardware address     Lease expiration
10.0.0.4 /24   1       0090.bff6.081e       Infinite

==== Static Route with the Next-Hop Dynamically Obtained Through DHCP

TODO: explanation/context

.Task: Assign a Static Route for the Default Next-Hop Device When the DHCP Server Is Accessed for an IP Address
----
# ip route <prefix> <mask> {<ip-address> | <interface-number> [<ip-number>]} dhcp [<distance>]
----

[NOTE]
====
- Ensure that the DHCP client and server are defined to supply a DHCP device option 3 of the DHCP packet.
- If the DHCP client is not able to obtain an IP address or the default device IP address, the static route is not installed in the routing table.
- If the lease has expired and the DHCP client cannot renew the address, the DHCP IP address assigned to the client is released and any associated static routes are removed from the routing table.
====

=== Statistics


.Task: Display Server Statistics

== DHCP Client

.Task: Acquire an IP Address on an Interface from DHCP
----
(config-if)# ip address dhcp
----

.Task: Display the DHCP Packets Sent and Received During Troubleshooting on the Client Side
----
# debug dhcp detail
----

.Task: Force a Release Of a DHCP Lease
----
# release dhcp
----

[NOTE]
====
The *release dhcp* command

- Starts the process to immediately release a DHCP lease for the specified interface.
- Does not deconfigure the *ip address dhcp* command specified in the configuration file for the interface.
====

.Task: Force a Renewal Of a DHCP Lease
----
# renew dhcp
----

[NOTE]
====
- The *renew dhcp* command advances the DHCP lease timer to the next stage,
  at which point one of the following occurs:

    ** If the lease is currently in a BOUND state, the lease is advanced to the RENEW state and a DHCP RENEW request is sent.
    ** If the lease is currently in a RENEW state, the timer is advanced to the REBIND state and a DHCP REBIND request is sent.

- If there is no response to the RENEW request,
the interface remains in the RENEW state.
In this case, the lease timer will advance to the REBIND state and subsequently send a REBIND request.

- If a NAK response is sent in response to the RENEW request, the interface is deconfigured.
====

=== Configurable DHCP Client Feature

- Allows a client to use a user-specified client identifier, class identifier or suggested lease time when requesting an address from a DHCP server.

== Accounting and Security

- Address vulnerability in PWLAN

=== DHCP Accounting

- add AAA and RADIUS support to DHCP configuration
- sends secure START/STOP accounting messages upon lease assignment/termination
- Restrictions:
  ** AAA and RADIUS must be enabled
  ** only for network pools with automatic bindings
  ** *clear ip dhcp binding* or *no service dhcp* triggers accounting STOP messages

.Task: Enable DHCP Accounting If a Specifier Server Group Is Configured to Run RADIUS Accounting

=== DHC Secured IP Address Assignment

- Secures and synchronizes the MAC address of the client to the DHCP binding,
preventing hackers form spoofing the DHCP server and taking over a DHCP lease of an authorized client

.Task: Secure ARP Table Entries to DHCP Leases In the DHCP Database
----
(dhcp-config)# update arp
----

[NOTE]
====
- Existing active DHCP leases will not be secured until they are renewed.
====

.Task: Configure the Renewal Policy for Unknown Clients
----
(dhcp-config)# renew deny unknown
----

[NOTE]
====
- In some usage scenarios, such as a wireless hotspot,
  where both DHCP and secure ARP are configured, a
  connected client device might go to sleep or suspend for
  a period of time. If the suspended time period is
  greater than the secure ARP timeout (default of 91
  seconds), but less than the DHCP lease time, the client
  can awake with a valid lease, but the secure ARP timeout
  has caused the lease binding to be removed because the
  client has been inactive. When the client awakes, the
  client still has a lease on the client side but is
  blocked from sending traffic. The client will try to
  renew its IP address but the DHCP server will ignore the
  request because the DHCP server has no lease for the
  client. The client must wait for the lease to expire
  before being able to recover and send traffic again.

- To remedy this situation, use the *renew deny unknown*
  command in DHCP pool configuration mode. This command
  forces the DHCP server to reject renewal requests from
  clients if the requested address is present at the
  server but is not leased. The DHCP server sends a
  DHCPNAK denial message to the client, which forces the
  client back to its initial state. The client can then
  negotiate for a new lease immediately, instead of
  waiting for its old lease to expire.
