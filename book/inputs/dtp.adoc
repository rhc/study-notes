= DTP

Dynamic Trunk Protocol

- negotiate trunk status
- default to *dynamic auto*
- both sides must be on the same VTP domain or one must be in the NULL domain

|===
Configuration Command : Short name : Meaning : To trunk other side must be
switchport mode trunk : Trunk:  Always trunks on this end; sends DTP to help other side choose to trunk: On, desirable, auto
switchport mode trunk ; switchport nonegotiate: Nonegotiate: Always trunks on this end; does not send DTP messages (good when other switch is a non-Cisco switch): On
switchport mode dynamic desirable:  Desirable: Sends DTP messages, and trunks if negotiation succeeds: On, desirable, auto
switchport mode dynamic auto: Auto: Replies to DTP messages, and trunks if negotiation succeeds: On, desirable
switchport mode access: Access: Never trunks; sends DTP to help other side reach same conclusion : Never trunks
switchport mode access; switchport nonegotiate : Access (with nonegotiate): Never trunks; does not send DTP messages: (Never trunks)

== Trunking Between a Switch and a Router

Because  DTP is not supported on Router

- on the router, create a sub-interface for each desired vlan
- on the switch, disable DTP and manually configure the trunk

== DTP and VTP

While DTP and VTP are independent protocols, DTP carries the VTP domain name in
its messages. Switches will successfully negotiate the link operating mode only if the
VTP domain name on both switches is the same, or one switch has no VTP domain name
configured yet (that is, it uses a NULL domain name). The reason behind tying the DTP
negotiation to the VTP domain name is that in different VTP domains, there might be different
sets of VLANs, and identically numbered VLANs might be used for different purposes
(that is why the network was split into several VTP domains in the first placeâ€”to
keep the VLAN databases separate and independent). As a result, switches should not try
to bring up the link as a trunk, as extending VLANs from one VTP domain to another can
have undesired consequences.
