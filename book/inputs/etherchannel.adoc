= EtherChannel
:icons: font
:experimental:


- EtherChannel aggregates bandwidth of up to 8 physical links
- Consists of two parts:
  * Port-channel interface: logical interface representing the bundle
  * Member interfaces: physical links part of the bundle

- can be any type of interface: Layer 2 access, trunk, tunnel or layer 3 routed

- Configured as either Layer 2 or Layer 3 interfaces.

- To be part of a PortChannel, both sides must agree on:

* Same speed and duplex settings
* If not trunking, same access VLAN
* If trunking, same trunk type, allowed VLANs, and native VLAN
* On a single switch, each port in a PortChannel must have the same STP cost per VLAN on all links in the PortChannel
* No ports with SPAN configured

- When several EtherChannel bundles exist between two switches,
STP blocks one of the bundles to prevent redundant links.
When spanning tree blocks one of the redundant links, it blocks one EtherChannel,
thus blocking all the ports belonging to this EtherChannel link.

- Where there is only one EtherChannel link,
all physical links in the EtherChannel are active because STP sees only one (logical) link.

- If a link within an EtherChannel fails,
traffic previously carried over that failed link changes to the remaining links within the EtherChannel.
A trap is sent for a failure, identifying the switch, the EtherChannel, and the failed link.
Inbound broadcast and multicast packets on one link in an EtherChannel are blocked from returning on any other link of the EtherChannel.

- Each EtherChannel has a logical port-channel interface numbered from 1 to 64.
The channel groups are also numbered from 1 to 64.

- When a port joins an EtherChannel, the physical interface for that port is shut down.
- When the port leaves the port-channel, its physical interface is brought up,
  and it has the same configuration as it had before joining the EtherChannel.

== Link Aggregation Protocol

- PAgP
  * Maximum 8 ports
- LACP
  * Maximum 16 ports
  * Maximum 8 active ports and 8 standby ports

.Task: Verify Which Negotiation Protocol Has Been Used for the EtherChannel
----
# show etherchannel protocol
----

.Task: Specify the Link Aggregation Protocol Globally
----
(config-if)# channel-protocol {pagp | lacp}
----

[NOTE]
====
- The *channel-group* interface configuration command can also set the mode for the EtherChannel
- If you set the protocol by using *channel-protocol*,
  the setting is not overriden by the *channel-group* interface configuration command.
====

== Layer 2 EtherChannels

- Logical interfaces are dynamically created when using *channel-group* command.

.Task: Configure Layer 2 EtherChannels
----
conf t
interface <type slot/number>
  switchport mode {access | trunk}
  channel-group n mode {active | passive | on | {auto [non-silent] | desirable [non-silent]  }
----

== Layer 3 EtherChannels

.Task: Create the Port Channel Logical Interface
----
conf t
interface port-channel <number>
  no switchport
  ip address <a.b.c.d> <mask>
----

.Task: Assign the Physical Interfaces to the Layer 3 Port Channel
----
conf t
interface <type id>
  no switchport
  no ip address
  channel-group n mode {active | passive | on | {auto [non-silent] | desirable [non-silent]  }
----

[TIP]
====
- Always issue the *no switchport* command before the *channel-group* command
- If L3 port-channel configured properly, the *show etherchannel summary* command should show *RU* for routed and in use

Cisco PAgP : 802.1AD LACP : Description

on         : on           : disable negotiation and forces the port into the portChannel
off        : off          : disable negotiation and prevents the ports to be part of the portChannel

=== PAgP and LACP Interaction with Other Features

- DTP and CDP send and receive packets over the physical interfaces in the EtherChannel.
- PAgP and LACP transmit PDUs on the lowest numbered VLAN on the interfaces enable for (desirable,auto or active,passive)
- STP sends packets over the first interface in the Etherchannel
- The MAC address of a Layer 3 EtherChannel is the MAC address of the first interface in the port-channel.

=== Load Balancing and Forwarding Modes

- Load balancing between member interface based on a combination of
  * Source MAC address
  * Destination MAC address
  * Source IP address
  * Destination IP address
- Uses only source MAC address by default

.Task: Configure the EtherChannel Load-Balancing Method
----
(config)# port-channel load-balance { dst-ip | dst-mac | src-dst-ip | src-dst-mac | src-ip | src-mac}
----

.Task: Display the EtherChannel Load-Balancing Method
----
# show etherchannel load-balance

EtherChannel Load-Balancing Configuration:
src-mac

EtherChannel Load-Balancing Addresses Used Per-Protocol:
Non-IP: Source MAC address
IPv4: Source MAC address
IPv6: Source MAC address

== EtherChannel Misconfiguration Guard

- This mechanism makes an assumption that if multiple ports are correctly bundled
into a Port-channel at the neighbor side, all BPDUs received over links in this
Port-channel must have the same source MAC address in their Ethernet header, as
the Port-channel interface inherits the MAC address of one of its physical
member ports. If BPDUs sourced from different MAC addresses are received on a
Port-channel interface, it is an indication that the neighbor is still treating
the links as individual, and the entire Port-channel will be err-disabled
- Enabled by default
