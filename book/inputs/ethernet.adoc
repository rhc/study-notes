Preamble DIX or Preamble and Start of Frame Delimiter(802.3)::
- 62 alternating 1s and 0s, and ends with a pair of 1s.
- For clocking synchronization of the transmitted signal.

Type::
- Type of protocol

Length::
- Length in bytes of the data following the Length field, up to the Ethernet trailer.
- the max length of the ethernet frame is 1518 bytes
- the min length of the ethernet frame is 64 bytes

DA::
- Destination address can be an individual or group address

SA::
- Source address is always unicast address

DSAP::
- Destination Service Access Protocol
- The size limitations, along with other Point (802.2) uses of the low-order bits, required the later addition of SNAP headers.

SSAP::
- Source Service Access Protocol
- Describes the upper-layer protocol Point (802.2) that created the frame.

Control::
- Enables both connectionless and connection-oriented operation.
- Generally used only for connectionless operation by modern protocols, with a 1-byte value of 0x03.

SNAP OUI ::
- Generally unused today,
- Providing a place for the sender of the frame to code the OUI representing the manufacturer of the Ethernet NIC.

SNAP Type::
- Using same values as the DIX Type field, overcoming deficiencies with size and use of the DSAP field.

Data::
- N bytes where 46 <= N <= 1500
- If N < 46, use padding

FCS (Frame check sequence)::
- Contains a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value
- Calculated by the sending MAC
- Re-calculated by the receiving MAC to check for damaged frames.
- Generated from the DA, SA, Length/Type, and Data fields

== Ethernet MAC Addresses

- 48 bits in hexadecimal
- Canonical transmission (little endian)= MSO to LSO with LSB to MSB for each octet where

** I/G bit: (0/1) Individual or Group address, first bit to be transmitted as LSB of MSO
** U/L bit: (0/1) Universally or Locally administrated, second bit to be transmitted

== Auto-Negotiation, Speed and Duplex

- By default, Ethernet auto-negotiation uses FLP (Fast Link Pulses) to determine the speed and duplex setting.
- To disable auto-negotiation, manually configure the speed and the duplex settings.
- if auto-negotation is disabled on one end by statically setting the speed , the other end
  ** detects the speed based on the incoming electrical signal
  ** sets duplex to half for 10 and 100 Mbps and full duplex for 1Gbps interfaces

- if auto-negotation is disabled on both end and different speeds statically configured, link down

== Troubleshooting

Runts::
- Runts are frames smaller than 64 bytes.

Overruns::
-  The number of times the receiver hardware was unable to hand received data to a hardware buffer.
-  Common Cause: The input rate of traffic exceeded the ability of the receiver to handle the data.

Ignores::
- The number of received packets ignored by the interface because the interface hardware ran low on internal buffers.
- Common Causes: Broadcast storms and bursts of noise can cause the ignored count to be increased.


CRC errors::
- The frame’s cyclic redundancy checksum value does not match the one calculated by the switch or router.

Frames::
- Frame errors have a CRC error and contain a noninteger number of octets.

Alignment::
- Alignment errors have a CRC error and an odd number of octets.

Collisions::
- Look for collisions on a full-duplex interface (meaning that the interface operated in half-duplex mode at some point in the past),
or excessive collisions on a half-duplex interface.
- Excessive collisions occur when a frame is dropped because the switch encounters 16 collisions in a row.

Late collisions on a half-duplex interface::
- A late collision occurs after the first 64 bytes of a frame.
- Late collisions occur after every device on the wire should have recognized that the wire was in use.

Possible causes of collisions include:

- A cable that is out of specification (either too long, the wrong type, or defective)
- A bad network interface card (NIC) card (with physical problems or driver problems)
- A port duplex misconfiguration
- A port duplex misconfiguration is a common cause of the errors because of failures to negotiate the speed and duplex properly between two directly connected devices (for example, a NIC that connects to a switch). Only half-duplex connections should ever have collisions in a LAN. Because of the carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) nature of Ethernet, collisions are normal for half duplex, as long as the collisions do not exceed a small percentage of traffic.

==== Misc: how does Ethennet know how long a frame is ?

TODO

Answer1
The Physical Coding Sublayer is responsible for delimiting the frames, and
sending them up to the MAC layer.

In Gigabit Ethernet, for example, the 8B/10B encoding scheme uses a 10 bit
codegroup to encode an 8-bit byte. The extra two bits tell whether a byte is
control information or data. Control information can be Configuration,
Start_of_packet, End_of_packet, IDLE, Carrier_extend, Error_propagation.

That is how a NIC knows where a frame start and ends. This also means that the
length of the frame is not known before it has fully decoded, analogous to a
NULL-terminated string in C.

Answer2
The length field inside the frame is not needed for layer1.

Layer1 uses other means to detect the end of a frame which vary depending on the type of physical layer.

with 10Base-T a frame is followed by a TP_IDL waveform. The lack of further Manchester coded data bits can be detected.
with 100Base-T a frame is ended with an End of Stream Delimiter bit pattern that may not occur in payload data (because of its 4B/5B encoding).
A rough description you can find e.g. here: http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/01120a.pdf "Ethernet Theory of Operation"
