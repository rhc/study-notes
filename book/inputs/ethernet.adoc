- Auto-MDIX (automatic medium-dependent interface crossover) 
** Detects the wrong cable and causes the switch to swap the pair it uses for transmitting and receiving, which solves the cabling
problem. 
**  Not supported on all Cisco switch models.

== Auto-negotiation, Speed and Duplex

By default, each Cisco switch port uses Ethernet auto-negotiation to determine the speed and
duplex setting. 

Switches can dynamically detect the speed setting on a particular Ethernet segment by using a few
different methods. Cisco switches (and many other devices) can sense the speed using the Fast
Link Pulses (FLP) of the auto-negotiation process. However, if auto-negotiation is disabled on
either end of the cable, the switch detects the speed anyway based on the incoming electrical
signal. You can force a speed mismatch by statically configuring different speeds on either end of
the cable, causing the link to no longer function.

.Task: Set speed for the interface
----
(config-if)# speed {10 | 100 | 1000 | auto | nonegotiate}
----

Switches detect duplex settings through auto-negotiation only. If both ends have auto-
negotiation enabled, the duplex is negotiated. However, if either device on the cable disables
auto-negotiation, the devices without a configured duplex setting must assume a default. Cisco
switches use a default duplex setting of half duplex (HDX) (for 10-Mbps and 100-Mbps
interfaces) or full duplex (FDX) (for 1000-Mbps interfaces). To disable auto-negotiation on a
Cisco switch port, you simply need to statically configure the speed and the duplex settings.
Ethernet devices can use FDX only when collisions cannot occur on the attached cable; a
collision-free link can be guaranteed only when a shared hub is not in use. The next few topics
review how Ethernet deals with collisions when they do occur, as well as what is different with
Ethernet logic in cases where collisions cannot occur and FDX is allowed.

== Switch  internal processing

Switches forward frames when necessary, and do not forward when there is no need to do so, thus
reducing overhead. 

To accomplish this, switches perform three actions:

- Learn MAC addresses by examining the source MAC address of each received frame
- Decide when to forward a frame or when to filter (not forward) a frame, based on the destination MAC address
- Create a loop-free environment with other bridges by using the Spanning Tree Protocol

Store-and-forward::

The switch fully receives all bits in the frame (store) before forwarding
the frame (forward). This allows the switch to check the FCS before
forwarding the frame, thus ensuring that errored frames are not forwarded.

Cut-through::

The switch performs the address table lookup as soon as the Destination
Address field in the header is received. The first bits in the frame can be sent out
the outbound port before the final bits in the incoming frame are received. This
does not allow the switch to discard frames that fail the FCS check, but the
forwarding action is faster, resulting in lower latency.

Fragment-free::

This performs like cut-through switching, but the switch waits for 64 bytes to be
received before forwarding the first bytes of the outgoing frame. According to
Ethernet specifications, collisions should be detected during the first 64 bytes of
the frame, so frames that are in error because of a collision will not be forwarded.
