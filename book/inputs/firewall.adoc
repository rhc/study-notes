== Firewall evolution

- acl - stateless packet filters
- alg application level gateway (web proxy)
- stateful packet filters
- ngfw

=== stateless packet filters

- classic ACL (standard, extended)
* RACL: ip filter on L3 interface
* VACL: ip and non-ip on vlan level 
* PACL: ip and non-ip on L2 interface

- cannot prevent L7 attacks
- not aware of the session concept
- adds management overhead 


=== alg

=== stateful packet filters

=== ngfw

- identity based access
- url filtering
- granular application visibility and control
  * facebook: video, audio, video traffic
- NG IPS
- Advanced malware protection
- Actionable indications of compromises
-  

=== asa vs cbac

- asa fw: dedicated platform
- ios cbac(context based access control): security feature on routers, obsolete
- ios zbf(zone based fw)

== ASA

=== platforms

- physical ASA 5500
- virtual ASAv

=== features

- app aware stateful filtering: ipv4, ipv6
- routing: static, ripv2, eigrp, ospf, bgp, multicast, dhcp
- nat: static, dynamic, pat, source/dest nat, twice-nat
- vpn: ssl, ikev1, ikev2
- firepower module

=== deployment modes

- routed fw
  * traffic is routed between interfaces in different subnets/vlans
  * physical interfaces are L3 ports with ip addresses 
- transparent fw
  * traffic is bridged between interfaces in the same subnet

NOTE: SVI interfaces can be used for routed fw deployment ???

=== modes of operation

- single-context (default)
- multiple-context
  * pseudo-virtualization
  * physical box resources shared between contexts, configurable
  * each context is virtual fw (with its own policies)

=== high availability

active-standby::
- pair of 2 identical firewalls   
- single-context mode
- same release/major code , minor version can be different
- configuration and session state table replicated from active to standby

active-active::
- pair of 2 identical firewalls
- multi-context: 
  * both forwarding but for different contexts
  * within one context , it is still active-standby mode
  * configs and session state table replicated from active to standby within each context

clustering::
- pair of multiple ASA's grouped as one logical unit
- higher performance, 
- load-sharing traffic
- built-in redundancy 

=== ASA routed mode initialization

- mandatory config on each intf
  * ip address
  * nameif: logical name 
  * security-level: 0(outside,untrusted)..100(inside, trusted)

=== basic routing

- similar to ios
- ASA uses subnet masks instead of wildcard
- closed-mode: by default, no access for management by telnet/ssh/http/https access 
- to manage it remotely, 
  * enable the protocol (only telnet by default)
  * configure allowed IP addresses to connect for mgt
  * configure AAA for auth
  * define users in the local db 
- ASDM: 

.example 
conf t
int gi0/0
  ip addresss
  no shut
  nameif INSIDE
int gi0/1
  ip address 
  no shut
  nameif OUTSIDE


=== basic fw policies

- by default,
* permit outbound traffic, from higher security level to lower sec lvl
* block inbound traffic, from lower sec level to higher sec level 

- ACL can be applied globally or at interface level 

- like ios, asa ACL matches traffic based on:
  source, destination, ip address, tcp/udp port, protocol number

NOTE: ASA uses subnet masks instead of IOS wildcard mask


=== object groups

- protocol: tcp, udp, esp, gre
- network: ip address, subnet address
- service: tcp/udp port numbers
- icmp type: echo, echo-reply, unreachable


== mpf

modular policy framework

- match on traffic using class-maps 
- define fw policy using policy-maps
- activate fw policy using service-policy
  * globally 
  * interface level 

- inspection config
  with asa default
  wihout asa default

sh run class-map
sh run policy-map
sh run service-policy
sh service-policy


== nat implementation


- object-nat
- twice-nat 

=== order of processing

- manual nat (twice-nat)
- auto nat (object-nat)
- after-auto manual nat

=== configuration

- identify which nat type (static/dynamic/policy)
- identify which configuration option best meets the requirements (object-nat, twice-nat)
- object-nat
  * define the object
  * configure the nat statement within the object
- twice-nat
  * define objects or object-groups to be used 
  * configure the nat statement globally

sh nat [detail]
sh xlate
sh conn long


== zbf

- stateful fw implementation on ios router
- 

c3pl cisco common classification policy language

- define security zone
- classify traffic to be inspected by the  fw
- define fw policies for classified traffic
- activate fw policies between security zones
- attach interfaces to security zones

=== security zones
  
- system pre-defined:
  * name: self-zone
  * cannot be changed or deleted
  * for traffic destined to or initiated by the router (management plane, control plane)
  * interfaces cannot be assigned to self zone
- user-defined
  * for data plane traffic
  * interface belongs to only one zone


=== traffic classification
  
-  class-maps
  * L4 for traffic classification
    ** access-lists or protocol
    ** other class-maps (nesting)
    ** match-any (OR operation)
    ** match-all (AND operation, default)
  * L7 for deep packet inspection

- policy-maps
  * L4, for fw policies
  * L7 for dpi 
  * class-default with default action of drop


=== traffic control

- intra-zone
- inter-zone: drop by default
- zone to no-zone: drop


=== config

- sh policy-firewall config zone
- sh policy-firewall config class-map
- sh policy-firewall config policy-map
- sh policy-firewall config zone-pair
- sh policy-firewall session zone-pair <name>


== client ssl vpn 

== clientless ssl vpn

- no need to install  vpn client 
- uses browser for the ssl vpn tunnel
- does not support all IP traffic
- does not support DTLS and real-time applications due to proxying nature
- remote client is not allocated an ip address
- remote access client access 2 types of resources:
  * bookmarks: published in the web portal
    ** configurable only via ASDM
    ** stored in xml format in the flash
    ** natively supported bookmarks (http, https, ftp, cifs)
    ** non-native, require plug-ins (Citrix ICA, microsoft RDP/RDP2 terminal, telnet, ssh, vnc)
  * directly via native client application
    ** port forwarding: old, not recommended, supports only tcp client-server with static ports (ftp doesn't work)
    ** smart tunnels: transparently tunnels tcp apps inside ssl vpn tunnel, supports all tcp client-server apps
