= Frame Relay

== Concepts

=== Frame Relay Introduction 

- Connection-oriented layer 2 WAN technology.
- Speed between 56 Kbps to 45 Mbps
- Statiscally multiplex virtual circuits over a single physical link.
- NBMA (non broadcast multi-access)


=== Virtual Circuits 

- logical paths between two DTEs
- can be permanent (PVC) or switched (SVC)
- identifies with DLCI


=== Frame Relay Hardware Configurations

You can create Frame Relay connections using one of the following hardware configurations:

- Routers and access servers connected directly to the Frame Relay switch
- Routers and access servers connected directly to a channel service unit/digital service unit (CSU/DSU), which then connects to a remote Frame Relay switch

=== Frame Relay Frame Format

- Uses LAPF (link access protocol for frame - mode bearer services) which is a variation of the HDLC frame
- There is no control frame, no flow control, no error control, no sequence numbers

image::frame-relay-frame-format.png[height=100]


Flags:: 
binary number 01111110 at the start and end of the frame

Address:: 
The frame relay header contains the following information:

DLCI :::
- 10-bit DLCI 
- represents the virtual connection between the DTE device and the switch. 
- local significance 

EA :::
- Extended Address 
- 2 x 1 bit  ( 8th byte of each byte) 
- indicate whether the byte in which the EA value is 1 is the last addressing field. 

C/R:::
- Not currently defined.

FECN:::
- Forward-explicit congestion notification 
- 1 bit set by a switch
- indicate to an end DTE device that congestion was experienced in the direction of the frame transmission from
source to destination. 

BECN:::
- Backward-explicit congestion notification  
- 1 bit set by a switch
- indicates that congestion was experienced in the network in the direction opposite of the frame transmission from source to
destination. 

DE:::
- Discard eligibility  
- 1-bit set by the DTE device, such as a router
- indicates that the marked frame is of lesser importance relative to other frames being
transmitted and be dropped before other frame 

Data:: 
- Contains encapsulated upper-layer data. 
- variable-length field up to 16,000 octets. 

FCS:: 
- Frame Check Sequence 
- value computed by the source device and verified by the receiver to ensure integrity of transmission. 

=== Frame Relay Addressing

====  DLCI

- Data link connection identifier
- 10-bits
- local significance, unique between DTE and DCE

==== Dynamic Address Mapping

Dynamic address mapping uses *Frame Relay Inverse ARP* to request the next hop protocol address
for a specific connection, given its known DLCI. Responses to Inverse ARP requests are entered in
an address-to-DLCI mapping table on the router ; the table is then used to supply the
next hop protocol address or the DLCI for outgoing traffic.

Inverse ARP is enabled by default for all protocols it supports, but can be disabled for specific
protocol-DLCI pairs. As a result, you can use dynamic mapping for some protocols and static
mapping for other protocols on the same DLCI. You can explicitly disable Inverse ARP for a
protocol-DLCI pair if you know that the protocol is not supported on the other end of the connection.

==== Static Address Mapping

A static map links a specified next-hop protocol address to a specified DLCI.
Static mapping removes the need for Inverse ARP requests; when you supply a
static map, Inverse ARP is automatically disabled for the specified protocol on
the specified DLCI. You must use static mapping if the router at the other end
either does not support Inverse ARP at all or does not support Inverse ARP for
a specific protocol that you want to use over Frame Relay. 


=== LMI 

- Local Management Interface 
- Developed in 1990 by Cisco Systems, StrataCom, Northern Telecom, and Digital Equipment Corporation. 
- Extensions to basic Frame Relay specification like 

LMI global addressing :::
The LMI global addressing extension gives Frame Relay DLCI values global rather than local significance. 
DLCI values become DTE addresses that are unique in the Frame Relay WAN. 
The global addressing extension adds functionality and manageability to Frame Relay internetworks. 
Individual network interfaces and the end nodes attached to
them, for example, can be identified by using standard address-resolution and
discovery techniques. In addition, the entire Frame Relay network appears to be
a typical LAN to routers on its periphery.

LMI virtual cirtual status :::
LMI virtual circuit status messages provide communication and synchronization
between Frame Relay DTE and DCE devices. These messages are used to
periodically report on the status of PVCs, which prevents data from being sent
into black holes (that is, over PVCs that no longer exist).


LMI multicasting :::
The LMI multicasting extension allows multicast groups to be assigned.
Multicasting saves bandwidth by allowing routing updates and address-resolution
messages to be sent only to specific groups of routers. The extension also
transmits reports on the status of multicast groups in update messages. 

==== LMI Types

.Frame Relay LMI Types

[format="dsv", options="header",cols="20m,30,20,20"]
|===
LMI Type : Source Document     : Allowed DLCI Range : LMI DLCI
cisco    : Cisco Proprietary   : 16–1007            : 1023
ansi     : ANSI T1.617 Annex D : 16–991             : 0
q933a    : ITU Q.933 Annex A   : 16–991             : 0
|===


==== LMI Autosense

- Enables the interface to determine the LMI type supported by the switch.
- Since IOS 11.2, by default no need to configure LMI explicitly

- LMI autosense is active in the following situations:
** The router is powered up or the interface changes state to up.
** The line protocol is down but the line is up.
** The interface is a Frame Relay DTE.
** The LMI type is not explicitly configured. 

- How it works? 

** *Status request* : The router sends out a full status request, in all three LMI types, to the switch. The
  order is ANSI, ITU, cisco in rapid succession. 

** *Status messages* :  One or more of the status requests will elicit a reply
 from the switch. The router will decode the format of the
reply and configure itself automatically. If more than one reply is received,
the router will configure itself with the type of the last received reply.

- What happens when LMI is unsuccessful?

** Every N391 interval (default is 60 seconds, which is 6 keep exchanges at 10
seconds each), LMI autosense will attempt to ascertain the LMI type. 

[TIP]
The only visible indication to the user that LMI autosense is under way is that
*debug frame lmi* is turned on. At every N391 interval, the user will now see
three rapid status inquiries coming out of the serial interface: one in ANSI,
one in ITU, and one in cisco LMI-type. 

==== LMI Status


=== Encapsulation

Two choices for the encapsulation of network protocols over Frame Relay:

- Cisco
- IETF (RFC 2427) 

The encapsulation must be the same on the 2 DTEs.

TIP: Shut down the interface prior to changing encapsulation types. Although shutting down the interface is not required, it ensures that the interface is reset for the new encapsulation. 



=== Congestion Controls

- FECN, BECN, DE

Bit  : Meaning When Set                                    : Where Set
FECN : Congestion in the same direction as this frame      : By FR switches in user frames
BECN : Congestion in the opposite direction of this frame  : By FR switches or routers in user or Q.922 test frames
DE   : This frame should be discarded before non-DE frames : By routers or switches in user frames

- Adaptative shaping

=== Compression

Cisco IOS software supports three options for payload compression on Frame Relay VCs:
packet by packet, data stream, and Frame Relay Forum Implementation Agreement 9
(FRF.9). FRF.9 is the only standardized protocol of the three options. FRF.9 compression
and data-stream compression function basically the same way; the only real difference is
that FRF.9 implies compatibility with non-Cisco devices.

All three FR compression options use LZS as the compression algorithm, but one key
difference relates to their use of compression dictionaries. LZS defines dynamic dictionary
entries that list a binary string from the compressed data, and an associated smaller string
that represents it during transmission::
thereby reducing the number of bits used to send
data. The table of short binary codes, and their longer associated string of bytes, is called a
dictionary. The packet-by-packet compression method also uses LZS, but the compression
dictionary is built for each packet, then discarded::
hence the name packet-by-packet. The
other two methods do not clear the dictionary after each packet.

=== Frame Relay Fragmentation

==== FRF.12 

- uses FRF.12 for LFI over a Frame Relay PVC 
- IOS supports two methods for configuring FRF.12: 

** legacy configuration requires FRTS and a queuing tool 
** Frame Relay fragmentation at the interfaces (>= ios 12.2(13T))

==== FRF.11c 

- works only on Voice over Frame Relay VCs
- voice frames are never fragmented, and always interleaved without the need of any queing tool
- same configuration to the legacy style of FRF.12 once the VoFR VC has been configured


==== Multilink PPP

- Only option for Frame Relay-to-ATM Service Interworking. 
- MLP over FR uses PPP headers instead of the Cisco or RFC 2427 header, thereby enabling many PPP features
supported by the PPP headers. MLP and LFI configuration would simply need to be added
to that configuration to achieve LFI.
