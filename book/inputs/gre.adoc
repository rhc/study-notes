= GRE

- Generic Routing Encapsulation
- Tunnelling protocol developed by Cisco
- IP protocol 47
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2784[RFC 2784]
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2345[RFC 2345]
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1234[RFC 1234]

== Tunneling

- Tunneling uses encapsulates data packets with from one protocol inside a different protocol at the same OSI layer
and transports the data packets unchanged across a foreign network (which  may not support the passenger protocol).
- Unlike encapsulation, tunneling allows a lower-layer protocol, or same-layer protocol,
to be carried through the tunnel.

- *Passenger protocol* : The protocol that you are encapsulating. Examples: AppleTalk, IP, IPX.
- *Carrier protocol* : The protocol that does the encapsulating. Examples: GRE, IP-in-IP, L2TP,MPLS, STUN,DLSw+.
- *Transport protocol* : The protocol used to carry the encapsulated protocol. The main transport protocol is IP.

K::
- Key bit
- Set to 1 if

Reserved0::
- if any of bits 1-5 are non-zero, a receiver must discard the packet
  unless receiver implements RFC1701

Protocol Type::
- Ether protocol type (e.g. IPv4 -> 0x800)

IMPORTANT: GRE adds at least 24 bytes to the original IP ( 20 bytes for new IP header + 4 bytes for GRE header )

== GRE Keepalive

The GRE tunnel keepalive mechanism gives the ability for one side to originate
and receive keepalive packets to and from a remote router even if the remote
router does not support GRE keepalives. For GRE keepalives, the sender
pre-builds the keepalive response packet inside the original keepalive request
packet so that the remote end only needs to do standard GRE decapsulation of
the outer GRE IP header and then forward the inner IP GRE packet. GRE tunnel
keepalives timers on each side are independent and do not have to match. The
problem with the configuration of keepalives only on one side of the tunnel is
that only the router that has keepalives configured marks its tunnel interface
as down if the keepalive timer expires. The GRE tunnel interface on the other
side, where keepalives are not configured, remains up even if the other side of
the tunnel is down. The tunnel can become a black-hole for packets directed
into the tunnel from the side that did not have keepalives configured.

Specifies the number of times that the device will continue to send keepalive
packets without response before bringing the tunnel interface protocol down.

GRE keepalive packets may be configured either on only one side of the tunnel or on both.
If GRE keepalive is configured on both sides of the tunnel, the period and retries arguments can be different at each side of the link.

This command is supported only on GRE point-to-point tunnels.

.Task: Configure GRE Keepalives
----
(config-if)# keepalive [ period [retries]]
----

== GRE Tunnel

To build a tunnel, a tunnel interface must be defined on each of two routers
and the tunnel interfaces must reference each other.
At each router, the tunnel interface must be configured with a L3 address.
The tunnel endpoints, tunnel source, and tunnel destination must be defined,
and the type of tunnel must be selected.

Optional steps can be performed to customize the tunnel.

Remember to configure the router at each end of the tunnel.
If only one side of a tunnel is configured,
the tunnel interface may still come up and stay up (unless
keepalive is configured), but packets going into the tunnel will be dropped.

.Task: Summary Steps
----
interface tunnel <number>
  bandwidth <kbps>
  keepalive [<period> [<retries>]]
  tunnel source {<ip-address> | <interface-type interface-number>}
  tunnel destination { <hostname> | <ip-address>}
  tunnel key <key-number>
  tunnel mode [gre {ip | multipoint} | dvmrp | ipip | mpls | nos]
  ip mtu <bytes>
  ip tcp mss <mss-value>
  tunnel path-mtu-discovery [age-timer {<aging-mins>| infinite}]
----

[NOTE]
====
- The router should have a route to the destination address,
but not through the tunnel interface.

- Tunnel Key ID must match on both side of the tunnel.
It is used as a weak form of authentication

=== Configuration Example

Note that Ethernet interface 0/1 is the tunnel source for Router A and the tunnel destination for Router B.
Fast Ethernet interface 0/1 is the tunnel source for Router B and the tunnel destination for Router A.

Router A::

== GRE backup interface

  In this example, R4 and R5 use the backup interface feature along with duplicate routing information to perform both traffic engineering and redundancy. With the backup interface configured on R4’s and R5's point-to-point GRE Tunnel100 interface, R4 and R5 wait for the line protocol of Tunnel100 interface to go DOWN before GRE interface Tunnel45 is activated. The following rules and restrictions apply when implementing the backup interface functionality:

  The primary/active interface being backed up must be a point-to-point interface type, because its state can be better determined.
  The secondary/standby interface acting as backup can be any interface except sub-interface, because the state of the main interface determines the state of sub-interfaces in general


----
(config-if)# backup interface <intf-id>
(config-if)# backup delay <after-down> <before-up>
----

----
# sh backup
----


== Troubleshooting

Three reasons for a GRE tunnel to shut down:

- There is no route to the tunnel destination address.
- The interface that anchors the tunnel source is down.
- The route to the tunnel destination address is through the tunnel itself. “%TUN-5-RECURDOWN:Tunnel0“

With the above three reasons for tunnel shut down are problems local to the
router at the tunnel endpoints and do not cover problems in the intervening
network.

Also if the two routers tunnel modes do not match, the tunnel interface can
still stay in an up/ip state but the routers cannot forward packets because of
the mismatch encapsulation.
