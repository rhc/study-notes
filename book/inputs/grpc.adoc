= gRPC

In gRPC,
a client application can directly call a method on a server application on a different machine
as if it were a local object,
making it easier for you to create distributed applications and services.
gRPC is based around the idea of defining a service,
specifying the methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types.
On the server side, the server implements this interface
and runs a gRPC server to handle client calls.
On the client side, the client has a stub that provides the same methods as the server.
