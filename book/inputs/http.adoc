= HTTP(S)


- TCP 80
- TCP 443



Cisco IOS routers and switches support web access for administration, through
both HTTP and HTTPS. Enabling HTTP access requires the *ip http server* global
configuration command. HTTP access defaults to TCP port 80. You can change
the port used for HTTP by configuring the ip http port command. You can
restrict HTTP access to a router using the ip http access-class command,
which applies an extended access list to connection requests. You can also
specify a unique username and password for HTTP access using the ip http client
username and ip http client password commands. If you choose, you can also
configure HTTP access to use a variety of other access-control methods,
including AAA, using *ip http authentication [aaa | local | enable | tacacs]*.


You can also configure a Cisco IOS router or switch for Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) access. By default, HTTPS uses TCP port 443, and the port is configurable
in much the same way as it is with HTTP access. Enabling HTTPS access requires
the *ip http secure-server* command. When you configure HTTPS access in most IOS
Release 12.4 versions, the router or switch automatically disables HTTP
access, if it has been configured. However, you should disable it manually if
the router does not do it for you.

HTTPS router access also gives you the option of specifying the cipher suite of
your choice. This is the combination of encryption methods that the router will
enable for HTTPS access. By default, all methods are enabled

code| meaning

| 100 | Continue                                 | The server received the request and is in the process of giving the response.
| 200 | Okay                                     | The request is fulfilled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 301 | Move permanently                         | The resource requested has been permanently moved to a new location. The URL of the new location is given in the Location response header. The client should issue a new request to the new location, and the application should update all references to this new location.
| 302 | Found and redirect (or move temporarily) | the new location is temporary in nature. The client should issue a new request, but applications need not update the references.
| 304 | Not modified                             | In response to the if-modified-since conditional GET request, the server notifies that the resource requested has not been modified.
| 400 | Bad request                              | The server could not interpret or understand the request; there is probably a syntax error in the request message.
| 401 | Authentication required                  | The requested resource is protected and requires the client’s credentials (username and password). The client should resubmit the request with the appropriate credentials (username and password).
| 403 | Forbidden                                | The server refuses to supply the resource, regardless of the identity of the client.
| 404 | Not found                                | The requested resource cannot be found on the server.
| 405 | Method not allowed                       | The request method used (for example, POST, PUT, DELETE) is a valid method. However, the server does not allow that method for the resource requested.
| 408 | Request timeout                          | The request sent to the server took longer than the website’s server was prepared to wait.
| 414 | Request URI too large                    | The URI requested by the client is longer than the server is willing to interpret.
| 429 | Too many requests | The user sent too many requests in in a given amount of time (rate-limiting)
| 500 | Internal server error                    | The server is confused; this may be caused by an error in the server-side program responding to the request.
| 501 | Method not implemented                   | The request method used is invalid; this could be caused by a typing error, such as Get in place of GET.
| 502 | Bad gateway                              | The proxy or gateway indicates that it received a bad response from the upstream server.
| 503 | Service unavailable                      | The server cannot respond due to overloading or maintenance. The client can try again later.
| 504 | Gateway timeout                          | The proxy or gateway indicates that it received a timeout from an upstream server. 7 Now that we have looked at HTTP methods and return codes, let’s look at the data that is
