}
----

Type::
- 1: Host membership query 
- 2: Host membership report
- 3: DVMRP

Group Address::
- in Host membership query, zeroed when sent, ignored when received
- in Host membership report, IP host group address 


.IGMP Version 2 Format
[packetdiag, target="igmp-packet-format",size=200]

  default_fontsize = 12
  * Type [len=8]
  * Maximum Response Time [len=8]
  * Checksum [len=16]
  * Group Address [len=32]
}
----

Type::
- 0x11: Membership Query

  * Used by multicast routers to discover the presence of group members on a subnet.
  * A General Membership Query message sets the Group Address field to 0.0.0.0.
  * A Group-Specific Query sets the Group Address field to the address of the group being queried.
  * It is sent by a router after it receives the IGMPv2 Leave Group message from a host.

- 0x12: Version 1 Membership Report 
  - Used by IGMPv2 hosts for backward compatibility with IGMPv1.

- 0x16: Version 2 Membership Report
  * Sent by a group member to inform the router that at least one group member is present on the subnet.

- 0x17: Leave Group
  * Sent by a group member if it was the last member to send a Membership Report to inform the router that it is leaving
  the group.

Maximum Response Time::  Specifies the time limit for the corresponding report.

- The field has a resolution of 100 milliseconds, the value is taken directly.
- only in Membership Query (0x11); in other messages it is set to 0 and ignored by the receiver.

Checksum:: Carries the 16-bit checksum computed by the source.
- computed over the entire IP payload, not just over the first 8 octets,
even though IGMPv2 messages are only 8 bytes in length.

Group Address::
- Set to 0.0.0.0 in General Query messages and to the group address in Group- Specific messages.
- Membership Report messages carry the address of the group being reported in this field
- Leave Group messages carry the address of the group being left in this field.


.IGMPv3 membership query

  * Source Address(i) [len=32, stacked]

}
----

S::
- Suppress Router-side Processing if flag=1

QRV:: 
- Querier's Robusteness Variable
- If this is non-zero, it contains the Robustness Variable value used by the sender of the Query. Routers should update their Robustness Variable to match the most recently received Query unless the value is zero.

QQIC :: 
- Querier's Query Interval Code
- This code is used to specify the Query Interval value (in seconds) used by the querier. If the number is below 128, the value is used directly. If the value is 128 or more, it is interpreted as an exponent and mantissa.

Number of Sources (N)::
- This field specifies the number of source addresses present in the Query. 
- For General and Group-Specific Queries, this value is zero. 
- For Group-and-Source-Specific Queries, this value is non-zero, but limited by the network's MTU.



== Messages

- membership queries:
  ** general:  sent to 224.0.0.1 (all systems on a subnet)
  ** group-specific: sent to the group
- membership reports
  ** sollicited: sent to the group in v2, sent to 224.0.0.22 in v3
  ** unsollicited

** IGMPv2 Host and IGMPv1 Routers
*** When a host sends the IGMPv2 Report with the message type 0x16, which is not defined in IGMPv1,
a version 1 router would consider 0x16 an invalid message type and ignore it. Therefore, a version 2
host must send IGMPv1 Reports when a version 1 router is active. But how does an IGMPv2 host
detect the presence of an IGMPv1 router on the subnet?

*** IGMPv2 hosts determine whether the querying router is an IGMPv1 or IGMPv2 host based on the
value of the MRT field of the periodic general IGMP Query. In IGMPv1 Queries, this field is 0,
whereas in IGMPv2, it is nonzero and represents the MRT value. When an IGMPv2 host receives an
IGMPv1 Query, it knows that the IGMPv1 router is present on the subnet and marks the interface as
an IGMPv1 interface. The IGMPv2 host then stops sending IGMPv2 messages.

*** Whenever an IGMPv2 host receives an IGMPv1 Query, it starts a 400-second Version 1 Router
Present Timeout timer. This timer is reset whenever it receives an IGMPv1 Query. If the timer
expires, which indicates that there are no IGMPv1 routers present on the subnet, the IGMPv2 host
starts sending IGMPv2 messages.

** IGMPv1 Host and IGMPv2 Routers
*** IGMPv2 routers can easily determine whether any IGMPv1 hosts are present on a LAN based on
whether any hosts send an IGMPv1 Report message (type 0x12) or IGMPv2 Report message (type
0x16). Like IGMPv1 routers, IGMPv2 routers send periodic IGMPv2 General Queries. An IGMPv1
host responds normally because IGMPv2 General Queries are very similar in format to IGMPv1
Queries—except for the second octet, which is ignored by IGMPv1 hosts. So, an IGMPv2 router will
examine all Reports to find out whether any IGMPv1 hosts exist on a LAN.
*** While an IGMPv2 router knows that an IGMPv1 host is present on a LAN, the router ignores Leave
messages and the Group-Specific Queries triggered by receipt of the Leave messages. This is
necessary because if an IGMPv2 router responds to a Leave Group message with a Group-Specific
Query, IGMPv1 hosts will not understand it and thus ignore the message. When an IGMPv2 router
does not receive a response to its Group-Specific Query, it might erroneously conclude that nobody
wants to receive traffic for the group and thus stop forwarding it on the subnet. So with one or more
IGMPv1 hosts listening for a particular group, the router essentially suspends the optimizations that
reduce leave latency.
*** IGMPv2 routers continue to ignore Leave messages until the IGMPv1-Host-Present Countdown timer
expires. RFC 2236 defines that when IGMPv2 routers receive an IGMPv1 Report, they must set an
IGMPv1-host-present countdown timer. The timer value should be equal to the Group Membership
Interval, which defaults to 180 seconds in IGMPv1 and 260 seconds in IGMPv2. (Group Membership
Interval is a time period during which, if a router does not receive an IGMP Report, the router
concludes that there are no more members of the group on a subnet.)

=== v3

- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3376[RFC 3376] 
- source filtering SSM
- uses 224.0.0.22 for membership reports
- Backward compatible with v1 and v2
- include and exclude mode

.Task: Specify the IGMP Version
----
(config-if)# ip igmp version {1 | 2 | 3}
----

.Task: Return to the Default Version
----
(config-if)# no ip igmp version
----
NOTE: If you change to version 1,
you cannot configure the *ip igmp query-interval*
or the *ip igmp query-max-response-time* interface configuration commands.


== Querier

=== Querier Election

- Selects preferred router to send Query messages when multiple routers are connected on the same subnet
- Each IGMPv2 router sends general query message to 224.0.0.1 with its interface source address.
- The router stops upon receiption of query messages with lowest IP address
- => The router with the lowest IP address wins

=== IGMPv2 Query Timeout

- or Other Querier Present Interval
- period of time before the router takes over as the querier for the interface.
- By default, the router waits twice the query interval + one half of Query Response Interval.  After that time, if
  the router has received no queries, it becomes the querier.
- Default: 255 seconds ( 125 x 2 + 10/2 )

----
(config-if)# ip igmp querier-timeout <60-300-seconds>
----

== Maximum Response Time Field

- v1, fixed at 10 seconds
- v2, can be changed to control the burstiness of the response process especially with large number of active routers.

- Increasing the maximum response timer value also increases the leave latency;
the query router must now wait longer to make sure there are no more hosts for the group on the subnet.

- Default:10 seconds, range: 0.1 to 25.5 seconds

== Leave Process

- in v1, implicit exit
- in v2,
** host sends leave group message to group address,

== IGMP Proxy

- enables hosts in a unidirectional link routing (UDLR) environment that are not
directly connected to a downstream router to join a multicast group sourced
from an upstream network.

image::igmp-udlr.png[UDL scenario, 400, 400, float='right']

- Before you can see how this optimization improves multicast performance, you
  need to explore what a UDL routing scenario actually is. UDL creates a
  scenario that would normally be an issue for standard multicast and unicast
  routing protocols because of the fact that these routing protocols forward
  data on interfaces from which they have received routing control information.
  This model works only on bidirectional links for most existing routing
  protocols like those that we have discussed thus far; however, some networks
  use broadcast satellite links, which are by their very nature unidirectional.
  For networks that use broadcast satellite links, accomplishing two-way
  communication over broadcast satellite links presents a problem in terms of
  discovering and sharing knowledge of a network topology through traditional
  protocols like OSPF or EIGRP.
  This impacts PIM operation because of PIM
  reliance on these protocols.

- Specifically, in unicast routing, when a router receives an update message on
  an interface for a prefix, it forwards data for destinations that match that
  prefix out that same interface. This is the case in distance vector routing
  protocols like EIGRP. Similarly, in multicast routing, when a router receives
  a Join message for a multicast group on an interface, it forwards copies of
  data destined for that group out that same interface. Based on these
  principles, existing unicast and multicast routing protocols cannot be
  supported over UDLs. UDLR was designed to enable the operation of routing
  protocols over UDLs without changing the routing protocols themselves.

== IGMP Filtering and Throttling

- configures and apply IGMP profiles on a SVI, a per-port, or a per-port per-VLAN basis
- works only with IGMP snooping active globally or on the port

- When an IGMP packet is received, IGMP filtering uses the filters configured
  by the user to determine whether the IGMP packet should be discarded or
  allowed to be processed by the existing IGMP snooping code.

  * With IGMP v1/v2, the entire packet is discarded.
  * With IGMPv3 , the packet is rewritten to remove message elements that were denied by the filters.

=== IGMP Throttling Action

- When an interface receives an IGMP report and the maximum number of entries is in the forwarding table,
specify the action that the interface takes:

* deny : Drop the report.
* replace : Replace the existing group with the new group for which the IGMP report was received.

- works only if the maximum number of IGMP groups have been configured

– If the throttling action is *deny*,

* the entries that were previously in the forwarding table are aged out.
* After these entries are aged out and the maximum number of entries is in the
forwarding table, the switch drops the next IGMP report received on the
interface.

– If the throttling action is *replace*,

* the entries that were previously in the forwarding table are removed.
* When the maximum number of entries is in the forwarding table,
  the switch replaces a randomly selected entry with the received IGMP report.

- To prevent the switch from removing the forwarding-table entries,
  configure the IGMP throttling action before an interface adds entries to the
  forwarding table.


.Task: Configure IGMP Throttling Action
----
(config-if)# ip igmp max-groups action {deny | replace}

== IGMP Snooping

- Problem: L2 switch forwards multicast packets to all interfaces -> wasted traffic
- Solution: Tracks IGMP messages (Join/Leave) to only forward invites to interested parties.
  ** Add ports when receiving Join message
  ** Delete ports when Leave messages or no membership reports from clients

[NOTE]
====
- When a topology change occurs, the spanning-tree root sends a IGMP global leave with group 0.0.0.0.
- however, after *ip igmp snooping tcn query solicit* command,
the switch sneds the global leave message whether or not it is the spanning-tree root.
- When the router receives this special leave, it immediately sends general queries,
which expedite the process of recovering from the flood mode during the TCN event.
====

.Task: Disable the Flooding Of Multicast Traffic During a TCN Event
----
(config-if)# no ip igmp snooping tcn flood
----
[NOTE]
====
- When the swith receives a TCN, multicast traffic is flooded to all the ports until 2 general queries are received.
- If the switch has many ports with attached hosts subscribed to many groups,
this flooding might exceed the capacity of the link and cause packet loss.
