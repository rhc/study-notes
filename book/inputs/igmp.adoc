- Group membership protocol used by hosts to inform routers and multilayer switches
  of the existence of members on their directly connected networks and
  to allow them to send and receive multicast datagrams.
- IP protocol number: 2
- TTL: 1

== IGMP packet format


.IGMP version 2 format
[packetdiag, target="igmp-packet-format",size=200]
----
diagram {
  colwidth = 32
  node_height = 32

  * Maximum Response Time [len=8]
  * Checksum [len=16]
  * Group Address [len=32]
}
----

Type::
- Membership Query (Type code = 0x11):

  * Used by multicast routers to discover the presence of group members on a subnet.
  * A General Membership Query message sets the Group Address field to 0.0.0.0.
  * A Group-Specific Query sets the Group Address field to the address of the group being queried.
  * It is sent by a router after it receives the IGMPv2 Leave Group message from a host.

- Version 1 Membership Report (Type code = 0x12):
  - Used by IGMPv2 hosts for backward compatibility with IGMPv1.

- Version 2 Membership Report (Type Code = 0x16):
  * Sent by a group member to inform the router that at least one group member is present on the subnet.

- Leave Group (Type code = 0x17):

  * Sent by a group member if it was the last member to send a Membership Report to inform the router that it is leaving
  the group.

Maximum Response Time::  Specifies the time limit for the corresponding report.

- The field has a resolution of 100 milliseconds, the value is taken directly.
- only in Membership Query (0x11); in other messages it is set to 0 and ignored by the receiver.


Checksum:: Carries the 16-bit checksum computed by the source.
- computed over the entire IP payload, not just over the first 8 octets,
even though IGMPv2 messages are only 8 bytes in length.


Group Address::
- Set to 0.0.0.0 in General Query messages and to the group address in Group- Specific messages.
- Membership Report messages carry the address of the group being reported in this field
- Leave Group messages carry the address of the group being left in this field.


== Messages

- membership queries:
  ** general:  sent to 224.0.0.1 (all systems on a subnet)
  ** group-specific: sent to the group
- membership reports
  ** sollicited: sent to the group in v2, sent to 224.0.0.22 in v3
  ** unsollicited
- Leave Group messages

.Task: Display multicast-related information about an interface.
----
# show ip igmp interface [interface-id]

== IGMP version

v1::
- general membership queries
- join
- implicit leave

v2::
- group-specific queries
- explicit leave group process
- explicit max response time field
- querier election
- Backward compatible with v1

v3::
- source filtering SSM
- uses 224.0.0.22 for membership reports
- Backward compatible with v1 and v2

.Task: Specify the IGMP version
----
(config-if)# ip igmp version {1 | 2 | 3}
----

.Task: Return to the default version
----
(config-if)# no ip igmp version
----
NOTE: If you change to version 1,
you cannot configure the *ip igmp query-interval*
or the *ip igmp query-max-response-time* interface configuration commands.

== Querier election

- Selects preferred router to send Query messages when multiple routers are connected on the same subnet
- Each IGMPv2 router sends general query message to 224.0.0.1 with its interface source address.
- The router stops upon receiption of query messages with lowest IP address
-> The router with the lowest IP address wins

== IGMPv2 query timeout

- period of time before the router takes over as the querier for the interface.
- By default, the router waits twice the query interval.  After that time, if
  the router has received no queries, it becomes the querier.

----
(config-if)# ip igmp querier-timeout <60-300-seconds>
----

== Maximum response time field

- v1, fixed at 10 seconds
- v2, can be changed to control the burstiness of the response process especially with large number of active routers.

- Increasing the maximum response timer value also increases the leave latency;
the query router must now wait longer to make sure there are no more hosts for the group on the subnet.

- Default:10 seconds, range: 1..25.

.Task: Change the maximum response time field
----
(config-if)# ip igmp query-max-response-time <seconds>

NOTE: This method allows fast switching.
The outgoing interface appears in the IGMP cache,
but the switch itself is not a member,
as evidenced by lack of an L (local) flag in the multicast route entry.

----

== IGMP proxy

- enables hosts in a unidirectional link routing (UDLR) environment that are not
directly connected to a downstream router to join a multicast group sourced
from an upstream network.

image::igmp-udlr.png[UDL scenario]


- Before you can see how this optimization improves multicast performance, you
  need to explore what a UDL routing scenario actually is. UDL creates a
  scenario that would normally be an issue for standard multicast and unicast
  routing protocols because of the fact that these routing protocols forward
  data on interfaces from which they have received routing control information.
  This model works only on bidirectional links for most existing routing
  protocols like those that we have discussed thus far; however, some networks
  use broadcast satellite links, which are by their very nature unidirectional.
  For networks that use broadcast satellite links, accomplishing two-way
  communication over broadcast satellite links presents a problem in terms of
  discovering and sharing knowledge of a network topology through traditional
  protocols like OSPF or Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).
  This impacts Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) operation because of PIM
  reliance on these protocols.

- Specifically, in unicast routing, when a router receives an update message on
  an interface for a prefix, it forwards data for destinations that match that
  prefix out that same interface. This is the case in distance vector routing
  protocols like EIGRP. Similarly, in multicast routing, when a router receives
  a Join message for a multicast group on an interface, it forwards copies of
  data destined for that group out that same interface. Based on these
  principles, existing unicast and multicast routing protocols cannot be
  supported over UDLs. UDLR was designed to enable the operation of routing
  protocols over UDLs without changing the routing protocols themselves.

== CGMP


TODO: Create a seperate files for CGMP and IGMP snooping ?

- Cisco proprietary
- Layer 2 protocol, well-known MAC 0X0100.0CDD.DDDD
- configured on both the cisco router and switch.
- permits routers to communicate L2 info it has learned from IGMP to switches
- Only routers send CGMP messages while switches only listens to CGMP messages
- helps switches send group traffic to only those hosts that want it -> no wasted bandwidth



=== Message Format

- GDA: Group Destination Address
- USA: Unicast Source Address


.CGMP Messages
,==
Type  , GDA       , USA        , Description

Join  , Group MAC , Host MAC   , Add USA port to group
Leave , Group MAC , Host MAC   , Delete USA port from group
Join  , Zero      , Router MAC , Learn which port connects to the CGMO router
Leave , Zero      , Router MAC , Release CGMP router port
Leave , Group MAC , Zero       , Delete the group from the CAM
Leave , Zero      , Zero       , Delete all groups from the CAM

,==

.Task: Clear all the CGMP entries on the switches
----
# clear ip cgmp
----

=== Process

1. When a CGMP-capable router gets connected to the switch, it sends a CGMP Join
message with the GDA set to 0 and the USA set to its own MAC address.
The CGMP-capable switch now knows that a multicast router is connected to the port
on which it received the router’s CGMP message. The router repeats the message
every 60 seconds. A router can also tell the switch that it no longer
participates in CGMP by sending a CGMP Leave message with the GDA set to 0 and
the USA set to its own MAC address.

2. When a host joins a group, it sends an IGMP Join message. Normally, a
multicast router examines only Layer 3 information in the IGMP Join message,
and the router does not have to process any Layer 2 information. However, when
CGMP is configured on a router, the router also examines the Layer 2
destination and source MAC addresses of the IGMP Join message. The source
address is the unicast MAC address of the host that sent the IGMP Join message.
The router then generates a CGMP Join message that includes the multicast MAC
address associated with the multicast IP address (to the GDA field of the CGMP
join) and the unicast MAC address of the host (to the USA field of the CGMP
message). The router sends the CGMP Join message using the well-known CGMP
multicast MAC address 0x0100.0cdd.dddd as the destination address.

3. When switches receive a CGMP Join message, they search in their CAM tables
for the port number associated with the host MAC address listed in the USA
field. Switches create a new CAM table entry (or use an existing entry if it
was already created before) for the multicast MAC address listed in the GDA
field of the CGMP Join message, add the port number associated with the host
MAC address listed in the USA field to the entry, and forward the group traffic
on the port.

4. When a host leaves a group, it sends an IGMP Leave message. The router
learns the host’s unicast MAC address (USA) and the IP multicast group it has
just left. Because the Leave messages are sent to the All Multicast Routers MAC
address 0x0100.5e00.0002 and not to the multicast group address the host has
just left, the router calculates the multicast MAC address (GDA) from the IP
multicast group the host has just left. The router then generates a CGMP Leave
message, copies the multicast MAC address it has just calculated in the GDA
field and unicast MAC address in the USA field of the CGMP Leave message, and
sends it to the well- known CGMP multicast MAC address.

5. When switches receive a CGMP Leave message, they again search for the port
number associated with the host MAC address listed in the USA field. Switches
remove this port from the CAM table entry for the multicast MAC address listed
in the GDA field of the CGMP Leave message and stop forwarding the group
traffic on the port.


== RGMP

- Router-Port Group Management Protocol
- Proprietary with informational RFC 3488
- Layer 2
- doesn't work with CGMP
- works well with ICMP snooping

* IGMP snooping helps switches control distribution of multicast traffic on
 ports where multicast hosts are connected, but it does not help switches
 control distribution of multicast traffic on ports where multicast routers
 are connected.



=== Operations

- When RGMP is enabled on a router, the router sends RGMP Hello messages by
  default every 30 seconds. When the switch receives an RGMP Hello message, it
  stops forwarding all multicast traffic on the port on which it received the
  Hello message.

- When the router wants to receive traffic for a specific multicast group, the
  router sends an RGMP Join G message, where G is the multicast group address,
  to the switch. When the switch receives an RGMP Join message, it starts
  forwarding the requested group traffic on the port on which it received the
  Hello message.

- When the router does not want to receive traffic for a formerly RGMP-joined
  specific multicast group, the router sends an RGMP Leave G message, where G
  is the multicast group address, to the switch. When the switch receives an
  RGMP Leave message, it stops forwarding the group traffic on the port on
  which it received the Hello message.

- When RGMP is disabled on the router, the router sends an RGMP Bye message to
  the switch. When the switch receives an RGMP Bye message, it starts
  forwarding all IP multicast traffic on the port on which it received the
  Hello message.


.Task: Enable RGMP
----
(config-if)# ip rgmp
----

== IGMP filtering and throttling

- configures and apply IGMP profiles on a SVI, a per-port, or a per-port per-VLAN basis
- works only with IGMP snooping active globally or on the port

- When an IGMP packet is received, IGMP filtering uses the filters configured
  by the user to determine whether the IGMP packet should be discarded or
  allowed to be processed by the existing IGMP snooping code.

  * With IGMP v1/v2, the entire packet is discarded.
  * With IGMPv3 , the packet is rewritten to remove message elements that were denied by the filters.

=== Maximum Number of IGMP Groups

.Task: Set the maximum number of IGMP Groups
----
(config-if)# ip igmp max-groups <number>
----

=== IGMP Throttling Action

- When an interface receives an IGMP report and the maximum number of entries is in the forwarding table,
specify the action that the interface takes:

* deny : Drop the report.
* replace : Replace the existing group with the new group for which the IGMP report was received.

- works only if the maximum number of IGMP groups have been configured

– If the throttling action is *deny*,

* the entries that were previously in the forwarding table are aged out.
* After these entries are aged out and the maximum number of entries is in the
forwarding table, the switch drops the next IGMP report received on the
interface.

– If the throttling action is *replace*,

* the entries that were previously in the forwarding table are removed.
* When the maximum number of entries is in the forwarding table,
  the switch replaces a randomly selected entry with the received IGMP report.

- To prevent the switch from removing the forwarding-table entries,
  configure the IGMP throttling action before an interface adds entries to the
  forwarding table.


.Task: Configure IGMP Throttling Action
----
(config-if)# ip igmp max-groups action {deny | replace}
----



== IGMP snooping

- Problem: L2 switch forwards multicast packets to all interfaces -> wasted traffic
- Solution: Tracks IGMP messages (Join/Leave) to only forward invites to interested parties.
  ** Add ports when receiving Join message
  ** Delete ports when Leave messages or no membership reports from clients

----
[NOTE]
====
- When a topology change occurs, the spanning-tree root sends a IGMP global leave with group 0.0.0.0.
- however, after *ip igmp snooping tcn query solicit* command,
the switch sneds the global leave message whether or not it is the spanning-tree root.
- When the router receives this special leave, it immediately sends general queries,
which expedite the process of recovering from the flood mode during the TCN event.
====

.Task: Disable the flooding of multicast traffic during a TCN event
----
(config-if)# no ip igmp snooping tcn flood
----
[NOTE]
====
- When the swith receives a TCN, multicast traffic is flooded to all the ports until 2 general queries are received.
- If the switch has many ports with attached hosts subscribed to many groups,
this flooding might exceed the capacity of the link and cause packet loss.
