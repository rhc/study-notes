= IKE

- Internet Key Exchange
- part of ISAKMP (Internet Security Association Key Management Protocol) framework
  for authentication and key exchange between 2 peers
  to establish, modify and tear down SAs.
- uses UDP 500
- Establishes SA (security associations) or IKE tunnels
  which carry control plane and data plane traffic for IPsec
- uses Oakley and Skeme  key exchange technique
  * Oakley provides PFS (perfect forward secrecy) for keys, identity protection, authentication
  * Skeme provides anonymity, repudiability, and quick key refreshment.


== v1

rfc 2409, 4109

- phase 1: IKE SA negotiation (standard )
- phase 1.5: used only for remote-access (non-standard)
- phase 2: IPSec SA negotiation (standard)

=== Phase 1

- establishes a bidirectional SA between 2 IKE peers,
  * once established, either peer may initiate negotiation for phase 2
- negotiate a secure transmission channel between VPN peers
  * common shared secret key via DH exchange
  * additional secure keys derived from the common shared secret key

- Diffie-Hellman Exchange: algorithm for exchanging some public information to obtain common shared secret key

TODO algo graphviz

- modes:
* main mode: longer to negotiate, first 4 messages in clear-text, last 2 encrypted, usually seen in site-to-site vpn
  ** MM1: initiator sends SA proposal(hash, encryption, authentication, DH, lifetime),
  ** MM2: responder sends the matched SA proposal
  ** MM3: initiator starts the DH key exchange
  ** MM4: responder sends its own key => encryption is established for the SA
  ** MM5: initiator authenticates with its IP address
  ** MM6: responder authenticates with its IP address

* aggressive mode: faster to negotiate with 3 unidirectional messages, last message encrypted, not mandatory per RFC, usually seen in remote-access vpn
  ** AM1: initiator sends all information contained in MM1,MM2,MM3, and MM5
  ** AM2: responder sends all information contained in MM2,MM4, and MM6 (??? Check this)
  ** AM3: ?? sends the authentication that is contained in MM5

- vpn peers exchanges isakmp policies which consists of 5 attributes:
* authentication method: psk, rsa-sig, rsa-encr
* encryption algorithm: des, 3des, aes
* hash algo: md5, sha-1, sha-2
* dh group: 1,2,5, 14, 15, 16
* lifetime : negotiated value in seconds, default to 24h

=== Phase 2

- establishes 2 or more unidirectional SAs
* quick mode:
  ** QM1: initiator starts multiple IPsec SAs in a single exchange message with agreed-upon algorithms for encryption and hashing as well as what trafic is to be secured
  ** QM2: responder sends matching IPsec parameters
  ** QM3: After this message, there should be 2 unidirectional IPSec SAs between the peers


- what to protect (proxy-ACL/encryption-domain)
- how to protect (transform-set)
	** encapsulation protocol (esp, ah)
	** encryption (des, 3des, aes)
	** hashing (md5, sha-1, sha-2)
- lifetime in seconds/Kbytes (negotiated)


- proxy-ACL
* also known as crypto-ACL
* statically defined via extended ACL
* dynamically negotiated by vpn peers

- encapsulation mode
* transport
  ** less overhead
  ** preserves the original ip src/dest
  ** used for intra-site tunnels (encrypted traffic between host and server on LAN)
* tunnel
  ** hides original packet ip src and dest
  ** more overhead
  ** used for inter-site tunnels (router encrypts traffic on behalf of hosts)

- original Packet -> IP|TCP|Data
- AH transport mode -> IP|AH|TCP|Data
- AH tunnel mode -> IP~new~|AH| IP~original~|TCP|Data
- ESP transport mode -> IP|ESP~header~|TCP|Data|ESP~trailer~
- AH tunnel mode -> IP~new~|ESP~header~| IP~original~|TCP|Data |ESP~trailer~

- Phase 2 result is 2 unidirectional IPsec SA
- IPsec SA
  * defines the security used to protect data-plane traffic
  * combines secure keys, cipher algorithms and spi (security parameter index)

- Phase 2 perfect forward secrecy
  * optional
  * run additional dh exchange so Phase 2 IPsec SA keys are not derived from Phase 1 IKE SA keys
    => a compromised key does not compromise future keys
  * dh group has to match between vpn peers
  * dh group does not need to match with dh group from pahse 1
  * more secure, more CPU overhead

== IKEv2

- uses exchanges or request/response pairs
  * IKE_SA_INIT
    ** negotiates cryptographic algorithms
    ** exchanges nonces
    ** performs DH exchange
    ** equivalent to IKEv1 MM1,MM2,MM3,MM4 but done as a single request/response pair
  * IKE_AUTH
    ** authenticates the previous messages
    ** exchanges identities and certificates
    ** establishes an IKE SA and a child IPsec SA
    ** equivalent to IKEv1 MM5,MM6 as well as QM1,QM2 but done as a single request/response pair


- incompatible with IKEv1
  * rfc 7296 for difference between IKEv1 and IKEv2
  * ECDSA-SIG:
  * EAP
