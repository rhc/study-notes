= IOS-XE

- runs IOS as a process on top of Linux OS
- modular -> extensibility
- high availability
  ** Can upgrade one package without rebooting the whole device
- separates control plane (Forwarding and Feature Manager)
  and data plane (Forwarding Engine Driver)
  ** The FFM provides a set of APIs used to manage the control plane
  processes. The resulting outcome is that the FFM programs the data plane
  through the FED and maintains all forwarding states for the system. It is the
  FED that allows the drivers to affect the data plane, and it is provided by
  the platform.
