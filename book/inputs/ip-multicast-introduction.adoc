= IP Multicast


IP multicasting::
Sending a message from a single source to selected multiple destinations across a
Layer 3 network in one data stream.

.Multicast Address Ranges and Their Use
[cols="30,70"]
,===
Range                         ,  Usage

224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255  , IPv4 class D reserved for multicast applications
224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.255      , permanent groups; Assigned by IANA for network protocols on a local segment. Routers do not forward packets with destination addresses used from this range.
224.0.1.0 to 224.0.1.255      , permanent groups; Assigned by IANA for the network protocols that are forwarded in the entire network. Routers forward packets with destination addresses used from this range.
232.0.0.0 to 232.255.255.255  , for SSM applications.
233.0.0.0 to 233.255.255.255  , GLOP addressing. It is used for automatically allocating 256 multicast addresses to any enterprise that owns a registered ASN.
239.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255  , Administratively scoped addresses; for private multicast domains
Remaining ranges of addresses , transient groups; Any enterprise can allocate a multicast address from the transient groups for a global multicast application and should release it when the application is no longer in use.

== Mapping IP Multicast Address to MAC Addresses

ip -> mac address = (0x01005E) + 0 bit + last 23 bits of the IP address
