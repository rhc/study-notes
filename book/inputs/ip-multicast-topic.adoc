= IP multicast routing


== Cisco Implementation of IP multicast routing

The Cisco IOS software supports these protocols to implement IP multicast routing:

- Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is used among hosts on a LAN and
  the routers  on that LAN to track the multicast
  groups of which hosts are members.

- Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM) protocol is used among routers and
  multilayer switches to track which multicast packets to forward to each other
  and to their directly connected LANs.

- Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) is used on the multicast
  backbone of the Internet (MBONE). 
  The Cisco IOS software supports PIM-to-DVMRP interaction.

- Cisco Group Management Protocol (CGMP) is used on Cisco routers and multilayer switches 
connected to Layer 2 Catalyst switches to perform tasks similar to those performed by IGMP.
