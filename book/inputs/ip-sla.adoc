- menu:Configuration Guides[Network Mgt > http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipsla/configuration/15-mt/sla-15-mt-book.html[IP SLA] ]

To implement IP SLAs network performance measurement,

. Enable the IP SLAs Responder
. Configure the Required IP SLAs Operation Type
. Configure Any Options Available
. Configure Threshold Conditions
. Schedule the Operation
. Run the Operation for a Period Of Time to Gather Statistics
. Display and Interpret the Results with Cisco CLI or NMS with SNMP

== IP SLAs Operation Types

- ICMP echo, jitter, path echo , path jitter
- TCP connect
- UDP echo, jitter
- VoIP RTP, UDP jitter, gatekeeper registration delay, post-dial delay
- HTTP, FTP, DNS, DHCP

.Task: Configure Basic IP SLAs ICMP Echo Operation on the Source Device
----
(config)# ip sla <operation-number>
(config-ip-sla)# icmp-echo {<destination-ip-address>| <destination-hostname>}
                    [source-ip {<src-ip> | src-hostname} | source-interface <interface-name>]
(config-ip-sla-echo)# frequency <seconds>
----

== IP SLAs Responder

- for Cisco device only
- listens on specific port for control protol messages send by IP SLA operation
- on receipt of the control, open specified TCP or UDP port for specified duration
- disables the port after reponding to the IP SLA packet or specified timeout
- may use MD5 authentication for control message
- takes two timestamps at the target devices to eliminate processing time
- can track one-way delay, jitter, and directional packet loss
- requires NTP synchronization except for one-way jitter measurement

== IP SLAs Operation Scheduling

.Task: Schedule IP SLA Operation
----
(config)# ip sla schedule <operation-number>
                          [ life {forever} | <seconds> ]
                          [start-time {now | pending | after <hh:mm:ss> | [<hh:mm:ss>]}] [month day | day month } ]
                          [ageout <seconds>]
                          [recurring]
----

.Task: Verify IP SLA Configuration
----
# sh ip sla configuration
----

- You can create a multioperation group
* The frequency of all operations scheduled must be the same
* The list of operation ID numbers must be limited to a max of 125 chars including commas

.Task: Schedule a Group Of IP SLA Operations
----
(config)# ip sla group schedule <group-operation-number> <operation-id-numbers>
                          { schedule-period <schedule-period-range | schedule-together }
                          [ frequency <group-operation-frequency> ]
                          [ life {forever} | <seconds> ]
                          [start-time {now | pending| after <hh:mm:ss> | [<hh:mm:ss>]}] [month day | day month } ]
                          [ageout <seconds>]
                          [recurring]
----

.Task: Verify IP SLA Multioperation Configuration
----
# sh ip sla group schedule
----


== IP SLAs Operation Threshold Monitoring

- can send SNMP traps that are triggered by connection loss, timeout, round-trip time threshold,
average jitter threshold, one-way packet loss, one-way jitter, one-way mean opinion score, one-way latency
- can trigger another IP SLA operation

== MPLS VPN Awareness

- IP SLA operations can be configured for a specific VPN

== History Statistics

[horizontal]
Aggregated statistics:: By default, two hours of aggregated
statistics for each operation. Value from each operation cycle is aggregated
with the previously available data within a given hour.

Operation snapshot history::  snapshot of data for each
operation instance that matches a configurable filter, such as all, over
threshold, or failures. The entire dataset is available and no aggregation
takes place.

Distribution statistics::  frequency distribution over
configurable intervals. Each time IP SLAs starts an operation, a new history
bucket is created until the number of history buckets matches the specified
size or the lifetime of the operation expires. By default, the history for an
IP SLAs operation is not collected. If history is collected, each bucket
contains one or more history entries from the operation. History buckets do not
wrap.

== Troubleshooting Tips

- If IP SLAs operation is not running and not generating stats,
add the *verify-data* command in ip sla configuration mode
- Use *debug ip sla trace* and *debug ip sla error* commands
