= IPS

- Intrusion Prevention System: performs deep analysis of network traffic,
  takes protective action when it found signs of suspicious or malicious
  behavior.

== traffic inspection

- signature-based inspection:
  * rule-based or pattern-based
  * compares data in traffic against known attack signatures
  * must be continually updated to remain effective
- anomaly-based inspection:
  * statistical anomaly detection:Observes network traffic over time and builds a statistical profile of normal traffic behavior based on communication patterns, traffic rate, mixture of protocols, and traffic volume. After a normal profile has been established, statistical anomaly detection systems detect or prevent activity that violates the normal profile
  * protocol verification:Observes network traffic and compares network, transport, and application layer protocols that are used inside network traffic to protocol standards. If a deviation from standards-based protocol behavior is detected (such as a malformed IP packet), the system can take appropriate action.
  * policy-based inspection:analyzes network traffic and takes action if it detects a network event outside a configured traffic policy.
