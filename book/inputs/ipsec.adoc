== IPSEC headers

=== AH

- Authentication header
- IP protocol 51
- Creates a digital signature to ensure that the packet has not been modified
- Does not support encryption for data confidentiality
- Does not support NAT-T (NAT traversal)
- Not recommended unless authentication is all that is needed


=== ESP

- Encapsulating Security Payload
- IP protocol 50

TODO

== Transport mode

- Tunnel mode:
  * encrypts the entire original packet
  * adds a new set of IPsec headers to route the packet and provides overlay functions
- Transport mode:
  * encrypts and authenticates only the packet payload.
  * does not provide overlay functions and routes based on the original IP headers

=== IPv4 site to IPv4 site

- IPSec between two sites such as branch and a headquarter is known as site to site or LAN to
LAN tunnel.
- can be configured with or without GRE.
- IKE has two modes of operation, aggressive or main mode.
Main mode hides IKE/IPSec peer identities.

=== IPv6 in IPv4 tunnels

Generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnels sometimes are combined with IPSec, because
IPSec does not support IPv6 multicast packets. This function prevents dynamic routing
protocols from running successfully over an IPSec VPN network. Because GRE tunnels do
support IPv6 multicast , a dynamic routing protocol can be run over a GRE tunnel. Once a
dynamic routing protocol is configured over a GRE tunnel, you can encrypt the GRE IPv6
multicast packets using IPSec.


IPSec can encrypt GRE packets using a crypto map or tunnel protection. Both methods specify
that IPSec encryption is performed after GRE encapsulation is configured. When a crypto map
is used, encryption is applied to the outbound physical interfaces for the GRE tunnel packets.
When tunnel protection is used, encryption is configured on the GRE tunnel interface.

“%CRPTO-4-IKMP_BAD_MESSAGE: IKE” message from 150.150.150.1 failed its sanity check
or is malformed appears if the pre-shared keys on the peers do not match. In order to fix this
issue, check the pre-shared keys on both sides.

=== Site-to-Site VTI over IPsec

Virtual Tunneling Interface

The use of IPsec VTIs both greatly simplifies the configuration process when you need to
provide protection for remote access and provides a simpler alternative to using generic routing
encapsulation (GRE) or Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) tunnels for encapsulation and crypto
maps with IPsec. A major benefit associated with IPsec VTIs is that the configuration does not
require a static mapping of IPsec sessions to a physical interface. The IPsec tunnel endpoint is
associated with an actual (virtual) interface. Because there is a routable interface at the tunnel
endpoint, many common interface capabilities can be applied to the IPsec tunnel.
The IPsec VTI allows for the flexibility of sending and receiving both IP unicast and multicast
encrypted traffic on any physical interface, such as in the case of multiple paths. Traffic is
encrypted or decrypted when it is forwarded from or to the tunnel interface and is managed by
the IP routing table. Using IP routing to forward the traffic to the tunnel interface simplifies the
IPsec VPN configuration compared to the more complex process of using access control lists
(ACLs) with the crypto map in native IPsec configurations. DVTIs function like any other real
interface so that you can apply quality of service (QoS), firewall, and other security services as
soon as the tunnel is active.


IPsec VTIs allow you to configure a virtual interface to which you can apply features. Features
for clear-text packets are configured on the VTI. Features for encrypted packets are applied on
the physical outside interface. When IPsec VTIs are used, you can separate the application of
features such as NAT, ACLs, and QoS and apply them to clear-text or encrypted text, or both.
When crypto maps are used, there is no simple way to apply encryption features to the IPsec
tunnel.


There are two types of VTI interfaces:
- Static VTIs (SVTIs)
- Dynamic VTIs (DVTIs)

SVTI configurations can be used for site-to-site connectivity in which a tunnel provides always-
on access between two sites. The advantage of using SVTIs as opposed to crypto map
configurations is that users can enable dynamic routing protocols on the tunnel interface without
the extra 4 bytes required for GRE headers, thus reducing the bandwidth for sending encrypted
data. Additionally, multiple Cisco IOS software features can be configured directly on the tunnel
interface and on the physical egress interface of the tunnel interface. This direct configuration
allows users to have solid control on the application of the features in the pre- or post-encryption
path.



DVTIs can provide highly secure and scalable connectivity for remote-access VPNs. The DVTI
technology replaces dynamic crypto maps and the dynamic hub-and-spoke method for
establishing tunnels. Dynamic VTIs can be used for both the server and remote configuration.
The tunnels provide an on-demand separate virtual access interface for each VPN session. The
configuration of the virtual access interfaces is cloned from a virtual template configuration,
which includes the IPsec configuration and any Cisco IOS software feature configured on the
virtual template interface, such as QoS, NetFlow, or ACLs.
Dynamic VTIs function like any other real interface so that you can apply QoS, firewall, other
security services as soon as the tunnel is active. QoS features can be used to improve the
performance of various applications across the network. Any combination of QoS features
offered in Cisco IOS software can be used to support voice, video, or data applications.
