.Comparison with IPv4

Streamlined::
- Fixed length header + optional extension header
- Fragmentation fields moved out of base header
- IP options moved out of base header
- Header checksum eliminated
- Header length field eliminated
- Length field excludes IPv6 header
- Alignment changed from 32 to 64 bits

Revised::
- Time to live -> hop limit
- Protocol -> next header
- Precedence and TOS -> traffic class
- Addresses increased 32 bits -> 128 bits

Extended::
- Flow label field added

== Traffic Class

- 6 bits for ToS
- 2 bits for ECN

== Flow Label

- Sequence in a particular flow
- Originally created for giving real-time applications special service.
-  when set to a non-zero value now serves as a hint to routers and
switches with multiple outbound paths that these packets should stay on the
same path so that they will not be reordered.
- may be used to help detect spoofed packets

== Payload Length

- Size in bytes of the payload including any extension header
- Set to zero when a *Hop-by-Hop* extension header carries a *Jumbo Payload* option.





== Next Header

- Specifies the type of the next header.
- usually specifies the transport layer protocol used by a packet's payload.
- When extension headers are present in the packet this field indicates which extension header follows.
- The values are shared with those used for the IPv4 protocol field
- Extension headers only examined at the destination, except for the 'hop-by-hop options'.

- If a node does not recognize a specific extension header, it should discard the
packet and send a Parameter Problem message (ICMPv6 Type 4, Code 1).
- When a Next Header value 0 appears in a header other than the fixed header a node
should do the same.

=== Fragment Extension Header

- In order to send a packet that is larger than the path MTU,
  the sending host splits the packet into fragments.
- The Fragment extension header carries the information necessary to reassemble the original
 (unfragmented) packet.

== Fragmentation And Reassembly

- Unlike in IPv4, IPv6 routers never fragment IPv6 packets.
  * Packets exceeding the size of the maximum transmission unit of the destination link are dropped
  * The router sends a *Packet too Big ICMPv6 Type 2* message to the originating node
    , similarly to the IPv4 method when the Don't Fragment bit is set.

- End nodes in IPv6 are expected to perform path MTU discovery to determine the
  maximum size of packets to send, and the upper-layer protocol is expected to
  limit the payload size. However, if the upper-layer protocol is unable to do
  so, the sending host may use the Fragment extension header in order to
  perform end-to-end fragmentation of IPv6 packets. Any data link layer
  conveying IPv6 data must be capable of delivering an IP packet containing
  *1280 bytes* without the need to invoke end-to-end fragmentation at the IP
  layer.

IMPORTANT: if a data link layer physically cannot deliver an ipv6 datagram of 1280 bytes 
in a single frame then the link layer must provide its own fragmentation and reassembly mechanism,
separate from IP's own fragmentation mechanism, to ensure that a 1280-byte IP datagram can 
be delivered intact to the IP layer.

=== Fragmenting

- A packet containing a fragment of an original (larger) packet consists of two
parts: the unfragmentable part of the original packet (which is the same for
all fragments), and a piece of the fragmentable part of the original packet,
identified by a Fragment Offset. The Fragment Offset of the first ("leftmost")
fragment is 0.

- The unfragmentable part of a packet consists of the fixed header and some of
the extension headers of the original packet (if present): all extension
headers up to and including the Routing extension header, or else the
Hop-by-Hop extension header. If neither extension headers are present, the
unfragmentable part is just the fixed header.

- The Next Header value of the last (extension) header of the unfragmentable part
is set to 44 to indicate that a Fragment extension header follows. After the
Fragment extension header a fragment of the rest of the original packet
follows.

- The first fragment(s) hold the rest of the extension headers (if present).
After that the rest of the payload follows. Each fragment is a multiple of 8
octets in length, except the last fragment.

- Each Fragment extension header has its M flag set to 1 (indicating more
fragments follow), except the last, whose flag is set to 0.


=== Re-Assembly

- The original packet is reassembled by the receiving node by collecting all
  fragments and placing each fragment at the right offset and discarding the
  Fragment extension headers of the packets that carried them. Packets
  containing fragments need not arrive in sequence; they will be rearranged by
  the receiving node.

- If not all fragments are received within 60 seconds after receiving the first
  packet with a fragment, reassembly of the original packet is abandoned and
  all fragments are discarded. If the first fragment was received (which
  contains the fixed header), a Time Exceeded message (ICMPv6 type 3, code 1)
  is returned to the node originating the fragmented packet, if the packet was
  discarded for this reason.

- Receiving hosts must make a best-effort attempt to reassemble fragmented IP
  datagrams that, after reassembly, contain up to 1500 bytes. Hosts are
  permitted to make an attempt to reassemble fragmented datagrams larger than
  1500 bytes, but they are also permitted to silently discard any datagram
  after it becomes apparent that the reassembled packet would be larger than
  1500 bytes. Therefore, senders should avoid sending fragmented IP datagrams
  with a total reassembled size larger than 1500 bytes, unless they have
  previous assurance that the receiver is capable of reassembling such large
  datagrams


=== Security

- Research has shown that the use of fragmentation can be leveraged to evade
  network security controls.

- As a result, RFC 7112 requires that the first fragment of an IPv6 packet
  contains the entire IPv6 header chain, such that some very pathological
  fragmentation cases are forbidden.

- Additionally, as a result of research on the evasion of RA-Guard in RFC 7113,
  RFC 6980 has deprecated the use of fragmentation with Neighbor Discovery, and
  discouraged the use of fragmentation with Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND).


== Addressing

- 128 bits
- Represented in hexadecimal and uses 8 colon-separated fields of 16 bits.

=== IPv4 Vs IPv6

- Multiple ipv6 addresses on a logical or physical interface with equal precedence on IOS (only one primary
  ipv4 with optional secondary address)
- Automatic configuration of globally unique address (without the need of DHCP)
- Built-in neighbor discovery of neighbors, routers and gateways




=== Address Abbreviation Rules

- Whenever one or more successive 16-bit groups in an IPv6 address consist of all 0s, that
portion of the address can be omitted and represented by two colons (::). The two-colon
abbreviation can be used only once in an address, to eliminate ambiguity.

- When a 16-bit group in an IPv6 address begins with one or more 0s, the leading 0s can be
omitted. This option applies regardless of whether the double-colon
abbreviation method is used anywhere in the address.

| Address Type | Range | Application
| Aggregatable global unicast | 2000::/3|  Host-to-host communication; same as IPv4 unicast.

| Unique Local | FC00::/7 | RFC 4193 for private use (~ RFC 1918), non-routable via global BGP
|===

==== Unicast

===== Aggregatable Global Addresses

- Begin with binary 001 (hexadeximal= 2000::/3)

image::ipv6-unicast-address-format.png[height=150]

===== Link-Local Addresses

- Starts with FE80::/10
- Equivalent of Ipv4 169.254.0.0/16
- Follows by 54 bits set to 0
- Interface ID
- only one link-local address per interface
- Routers do not forward link-local traffic to other segments.
** non-routable between interfaces 
- used for 
  * SLAAC Stateless Address Auto-Configuration
  * ND Neighbor Discovery
  * RD Router Discovery

===== IPv4-Compatible Addresses

- One option is to have first 96 bits set to 0

----
0:0:0:0:0:10:10:100:16
::10:10:100:16
::A:A:64:10
----

- ::ffff:0:0/96 prefix is designated as an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.  With a
  few exceptions, this address type allows the transparent use of the Transport
  Layer protocols over IPv4 through the IPv6 networking.

===== Assign an IPv6 Unicast Address to a Router Interface

.Task: Enable Ipv6 on the Router
----
(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
----

.Task: Configure a Global Unicast Address
----
(config-if)# ipv6 address 2014:10:12::19:66/64
----

Router automatically configure a link local address on all IPv6 enabled interfaces.
However, you can explicitly configure one

----
(config-if)# ipv6 address fe80::1 link-local
----

Additionally, the configured interface automatically joins the
following required multicast groups for that link:

- Solicited-node multicast group FF02:0:0:0:0:1:FF00::/104 for each unicast and anycast address assigned to the interface
- All-nodes link-local multicast group FF02::1
- All-routers link-local multicast group FF02::2

- IPv6 redistribution ignores the “local” routes in the IPv6 routing table
(the /128 host routes for a router’s own interface IPv6 addresses)
whereas IPv4 has no such concept.

==== Multicast

===== IPv6 Multicast Address Format

- Begin with FF as the first octect, or FF00::/8
- The second octet specifies lifetime (permanent or temporary) and the scope (node, link, site, organization, global)

image::ipv6-multicast-address-format.png[]

.IPv6 Multicast Well-Known Addresses
[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
Function, Multicast Group, IPv4 Equivalent

All hosts , FF02::1,  Subnet broadcast address
All Routers, FF02::2, 224.0.0.2
OSPFv3 routers, FF02::5 , 224.0.0.5
OSPFv3 designated routers , FF02::6 ,224.0.0.6
EIGRP routers ,FF02::A, 224.0.0.10
PIM routers, FF02::D , 224.0.0.13
|===

Each router must join the *solicited-node group* (FF02::1:FF00:0000/104)  for all unicast and anycast traffic.
The last 24 bits come from the corresponding last 24 bits of the unicast or anycast address.
The *neighbor discovery* process uses solicited-node addresses.


==== Anycast

Anycast addresses can be assigned to any number of hosts that provide the same service; when other hosts access this
service, the specific server they hit is determined by the unicast routing metrics on the path to that
particular group of servers. This provides geographic differentiation, enhanced availability, and
load balancing for the service.

-----
(config-if)# ipv6 address 3001:fffe::104/64 anycast
-----

All IPv6 routers additionally must support the subnet router anycast address. This anycast address
is a prefix followed by all 0s in the interface ID portion of the address. Hosts can use a subnet
router anycast address to reach a particular router on the link identified by the prefix given in the
subnet router anycast address.


==== The Unspecified Address

- Represented by **::**
- Used as source address by an interface that has not yet learned its unicast addresses.
- Cannot be assigned to an interface
- Cannot be used as a destination address

==== How to Embed an RP Address Within a Multicast Group Address

- FF for a multicast address
- 7 indicates that the RP address is embedded in the multicast address
- X for the multicast scope
    * 1 node-local
    * 2 link-local
    * 5 site-local
    * 8 organization-local
    * E global
    * F reserved
- 0 in the first character of the second hextet
- Y for the RP interface ID from 1 to F
- 30 for the mask for the network (0x30 = decimal 48)
- Remaining hextets for the network prefix

=== IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration

Stateful autoconfiguration::
- Assigns a host its entire 128-bit address using DHCP

Stateless autoconfiguration::
- Assigns a host a 64-bit prefix,
and the host derives the last bit using EUI-64 process.

==== EUI-64 Address

- Split 48-bit MAC address in two 24-bit parts
- Place FFFE in the middle
- Set to 1 the universal/local bit (7th bit in the interface id )

Given the IPv6 prefix 2001:128:1f:633 and MAC address 00:07:85:80:71:B8,
the resulting EUI-address is 2001:128:1f:633:**2**:07:85**FF:FE**80:71B8/64

- Uses in 3 operations: duplicate address detection, neighbor reachability verification, layer 3 to layer 2 address resolution.

[NOTE]
IPv6 does not include ARP as a protocol but rather integrates the same functionality into ICMP as part of neighbor discovery.
The response to an NS message is an NA message .

==== Router Advertisement

- Routers advertise their presence and link prefixes, MTU, hop limits
- Source address: router's link-local address
- Destination address: all-nodes FF02::1 for periodic broadcasts, querying host address for response
- Icmp type, code: 134,0


A Cisco IPv6 router begins sending RA messages for each of its configured interface prefixes
when the *ipv6 unicast-routing* command is configured. You can change the default RA interval
(200 seconds) using the command *ipv6 nd ra-interval*. Router advertisements on a given interface
include all of the 64-bit IPv6 prefixes configured on that interface. This allows for stateless address
autoconfiguration using EUI-64 to work properly. RAs also include the link MTU, hop limits, and
whether a router is a candidate default router.

IPv6 routers send periodic RA messages to inform hosts about the IPv6 prefixes used on the link
and to inform hosts that the router is available to be used as a default gateway.
By default, a Cisco router running IPv6 on an interface advertises itself as a candidate default router.

==== Router Solicitation

- Host query for the presence of routers on the link
- Source address: querying host interface, or :: if not assigned
- Destination address: FF02::2
- Icmp type, code : 133,0

At startup, IPv6 hosts can send RS messages to the all-routers multicast address.
Hosts do this to learn the addresses of routers on a given link, as well as their various
parameters, without waiting for a periodic RA message. If a host has no configured IPv6 address,
it sends an RS using the unspecified address as the source. If it has a configured address, it sources
the RS from the configured address.

==== Duplicate Address Detection

//change this to an algorithm
To verify that autoconfigured or statically address is unique,
the host sends an NS message to its own autoconfigured address's corresponding solicited-node multicast address.
This message is sourced from the unspecified address ::.
In the target address field in the NS is the address the host seeks to verify.
If an NA from another host results, the sending host knows that the address is not unique

==== Neighbor Unreachability Detection

2 options:

- a host sends a probe to the desired host's solicited-node multicast address and receives an RA or an NA in response.
- a host, in communication with the desired host, receives a clue from higher-layer protocol (e.g. TCP ACK)

=== ICMPv6

- RFC 2463
- Two groups of messages: error reporting messages and informational messages
- IOS implements ICMP rate limiting by setting the minimum interval between error messages and build a token bucket

Limit ICMPv6 error messages with default interval 100 ms , and default token-bucket size 10.

=== DNS

- Provides resolution of domain names
- DNS records: AAAA (RFC 1886), A6 (RFC 2874)


=== CDP

- Cisco Discovery Protocol
- Provides extensive information about the configuration and functionality of Cisco devices.

.Task: Display IPv6 Information Transmitted In CDP
-------
# show cdp neighbors detail
-------

=== DHCPv6

- RFC 3315


Two conditions can cause a host to use DHCPv6:

- The host is explicitly configured to use DHCPv6 based on an implementation-specific setting.
- An IPv6 router advertises in its RA messages that it wants hosts to use DHCPv6 for
addressing. Routers do this by setting the M flag (Managed Address Configuration) in RAs.

To use stateful autoconfiguration, a host sends a DHCP request to one of two well-known IPv6
multicast addresses on UDP port 547:

- FF02::1:2, all DHCP relay agents and servers
- FF05::1:3, all DHCP servers

The DHCP server then provides the necessary configuration information in reply to the host on UDP port 546.
This information can include the same types of information used in an IPv4 network,
but additionally it can provide information for multiple subnets,
depending on how the DHCP server is configured.

To configure a Cisco router as a DHCPv6 server,
you first configure a DHCP pool, just as in IPv4
then enable the DHCPv6 service using the *ipv6 dhcp server pool-name*


TODO stateless vs stateful managed-config-flag vs other-config-flag

=== Access Lists

Similar with IPv4 access lists except that:

- Because Neighbor Discovery is a key protocol in IPv6 networks, access lists implicitly permit
ND traffic. This is necessary to avoid breaking ND’s ARP-like functionality.
You can override this implicit-permit behavior using deny statements in IPv6 access lists.

.Task: Configure an Interface to Filter Traffic Using an Access List
----
ipv6 traffic-filter access-list-name {in | out}
----

- IPv6 access lists are always named; they cannot be numbered (unless you use a number as a name).
- IPv6 access lists are configured in named access-list configuration mode, which is like IPv4
named access-list configuration mode. However, you can also enter IPv4-like commands that
specify an entire access-list entry on one line. The router will convert it to the correct
configuration commands for named access-list configuration mode.

== IPv6 tunneling

=== 6in4

- mechanism for migrating from IPv4 to IPv6 (RFC 4213)
- uses tunneling to encapsulate IPv6 traffic over explicitly-configured IPv4 links
* The 6in4 traffic is sent over the IPv4 Internet inside IPv4 packets whose
IP headers have the IP protocol number set to 41.
* In 6in4, the IPv4 packet header is immediately followed by the IPv6 packet being carried.
This means that the encapsulation overhead is simply the size of the IPv4 header of 20 bytes.
With an Ethernet MTU of 1500 bytes,
one can thus send IPv6 packets of 1480 bytes without fragmentation.
- Also referred to as proto-41 static because the endpoints are configured statically.
- generally manually configured

image::6in4.png[Manually configuration, dual-stack]

=== 6to4

- encapsulates the IPv6 packets into IPv4 which allows remote IPv6 networks to communicate across the IPv4
infrastructure(core network or Internet).
- The main difference between the manual tunnels and automatic 6to4 tunnels is
  that the tunnel is not point-to-point but it is point-to-multipoint.
- In automatic 6to4 tunnels, the IPv4 infrastructure is treated as a virtual non-broadcast multi-
access (NBMA). The IPv4 address embedded
in the IPv6 address is used to find the other end of the automatic tunnel.
- Point-to-multipoint 6to4 tunnels that can be used to connect isolated IPv6 sites can use
addresses from the 2002::/16 prefix.

=== ISATAP

- automatic overlay tunneling mechanism that uses the underlying IPv4 network as
a NBMA link layer for IPv6.

- Overlay tunneling encapsulates IPv6 packets in IPv4 packets for delivery across an IPv4
infrastructure (a core network). By using overlay tunnels, you can communicate with isolated
IPv6 networks without upgrading the IPv4 infrastructure between them. Overlay tunnels can be
configured between border devices or between a border device and a host; however, both
tunnel endpoints must support both the IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks.

IPv6 supports the following types of overlay tunneling mechanisms:
- Manual
- GRE
- IPv4-compatible
- 6to4
- Intra-site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)

=== 6RD

IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd) is a stateless tunneling mechanism which allows a Service
Provider to rapidly deploy IPv6 in a lightweight and secure manner without requiring upgrades to
existing IPv4 access network infrastructure. While there are a number of methods for carrying
IPv6 over IPv4, 6rd has been particularly successful due to its stateless mode of operation
which is lightweight and naturally scalable, resilient, and simple to provision.

http://goo.gl/JXYWEc[Further Reading]


=== 6VPE

The 6PE feature is particularly applicable to Service Providers who already run an MPLS
network or plan to do it. One of the Cisco 6PE advantages is that there is no need to upgrade
the hardware, software or configuration of the core network. Thus it eliminates the impact on the
operations and the revenues generated by the existing IPv4 traffic. MPLS has been chosen by
many Service Providers as a vehicle to deliver services to customers. MPLS as a multi-service
infrastructure technology is able to provide layer 3 VPN, QoS, traffic engineering, fast re-routing
and integration of ATM and IP switching. It is in a very natural manner that MPLS is put to
contribution to ease IPv6 introduction in existing production networks.

MPLS decoupling of the control plane and data plane provide an interesting alternative to the
integration and coexistence of IPv4, IPv6 and ATM over a single infrastructure, thus fulfilling
environments such as 3G networks where UMTS Release 5 needs in terms of transport: Cisco
6PE for IPv6 traffic, ATM over MPLS and regular IPv4 switching with its VPN, traffic engineering
and QoS extensions. From an operational standpoint, new CEs introduction is straightforward
and painless as it leverages the Layer 3 VPN scalability. Using tunnels on the CE routers is the
simplest way to deploy IPv6 over MPLS networks. It has no impact on the operation or
infrastructure of MPLS, and requires no changes to either the P routers (they don’t have to be
IPv6 aware) in the core or the PE routers connected to the customers.

6VPE is a technology that allows IPv6 VPN customers to communicate with each other over an
IPv4 MPLS Provider without any tunnel setup, by having the customer VPNv6 prefixes using a
v4-mapped IPv6 address as next-hop inside the provider's network and using IPv4 LSPs
between the 6VPEs. In 6VPE, labels must be exchanged between the 6VPEs for their VPNv6
prefixes, which means that the VPNv6 address-family must be activated on the IPv4 iBGP
session between the 6VPEs.

By default, the *mpls ip propagate-ttl* command is enabled and the IP TTL value is copied to the
MPLS TTL field during label imposition.
To disable TTL propagation for all packets, use the *no mpls ip propagate-ttl* command.
To disable TTL propagation for only forwarded packets, use the *no mpls ip propagate forwarded* command.
Disabling TTL propagation of forwarded packets allows the structure of the MPLS network to be hidden from customers, but not the provider.

== IPv6 Routing

=== Static Routes

Similar to IPv4 static routes except that:

- An IPv6 static route to an interface has an administrative distance of 1, not 0 as in IPv4.
- An IPv6 static route to a next-hop IP address also has an administrative distance of 1, like IPv4.
- Floating static routes work the same way in IPv4 and IPv6.
- An IPv6 static route to a broadcast interface type, such as Ethernet, must also specify a next-hop IPv6 address because

** IPv6 does not use ARP
** There is no concept of proxy ARP

=== IPv6 General Prefix

- as shortcut
  * e.g. if organization is assigned a /32, then all prefixes should be derived from this /32
  * helps in renumbering scenarios

.Task: Define an IPv6 general prefix
----
(config)# ipv6 general-prefix <name> <X:X:X:X::X>/<0-128>
