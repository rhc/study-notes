= IS-IS

- link-state protocol
- doesn't run over any other network protocol
* encapsulates messages directly in data-link frames
* sends to the layer 2 address called SNPA (sub-network point of attachment)

IDI:: Initial Domain ID
DSP:: Domain Specific Part
AFI:: Authority and Format ID
HO-DSP:: high-order DSP
- identifies the area
- can be divided in sub-fields

System ID::
- generally 6 octets
- between 1 and 8 octects
-

SEL::
- identifies particular services on the destination node
- if SEL = 0,
* identifies node NET (Network Entity Title)
* mandatory for is-is configuration

== Levels Of Routing

- Level 0 : ES-ES / ES-IS on the same link
- Level 1 : IS-IS intra-area
- Level 2 : IS-IS inter-area
- Level 3 : IS-IS inter-domain (inter AS)


== Adjancency

- Separate for L1 and L2
* L1 with same area
* L2

- possible adjacency states:

* Down: The initial state. No IIHs have been received from the neighbor.
* Initializing: IIHs have been received from the neighbor, but it is not certain that the neighbor is properly receiving this router’s IIHs.
* Up: IIHs have been received from the neighbor, and it is certain that the neighbor is properly receiving this router’s IIHs.



== Metrics

- assigned to individual interfaces
- default to 10
* not automatically recalculated if bandwidth changes
* manually set with *isis metric <number>*

- types of metrics

* Default: Required to be supported by all IS-IS implementations; usually relates to the bandwidth of the link (higher value represents a slower link)
* Delay: Relates to the transit delay on the link
* Expense: Relates to the monetary cost of carrying data through the link
* Error: Relates to the residual bit error rate of the link

- narrow (original) metrics
* 6 bits for interface
* 10 bits for complete path

- wide metrics
* 24 bits for interface
* 32 bits for complete path

TIP: Use same type of metrics in one area


== Packets

- Hello
- Link State PDU
- Complete Sequence Numbers PDU
- Partial Sequence Numbers PDU


=== Hello

- also called IIH (IS-IS Hello)
- separate L1 and L2 hellos in bcast network
- single L1L2 hellos on point-to-point link
- sent every 10 seconds per default
- defined Hold time with *isis hello-multiplier*
- do not need to match (contrary to OSPF)
- always the one-third of the configured values on DIS
* to detect the outage more readily

=== Link State PDU


- one single LSP
- may be fragmented by originator because of MTU
- uniquely identified by LSPID
* System Id
* Pseudo Node:
* Fragment Number
- uses Sequence Number for different version of the same LSP
- has a Remaining Lifetime
* default to 20 minutes
* refreshes every 15 minutes

NOTE: If the LSP’s Remaining Lifetime decreases to 0, the router will delete the
LSP’s body from the link-state database, keep only its header, and advertise
the empty LSP with the Remaining Lifetime set to 0. Flooding an empty LSP with
the Remaining Lifetime set to 0 is called an LSP purge. Router purging an LSP
will not flush the LSP from its link-state database just yet, though. The
expired LSP can be purged from the link-state database after an additional time
called ZeroAgeLifetime set to 60 seconds. This is done to ensure that the LSP’s
header is retained until the purged LSP has been safely propagated to all
neighbors. Cisco routers, however, appear to hold the empty LSP header for
another 20 minutes.

=== Complete Sequence Numbers PDU

- contains list of LSPID
- doesn't contain the LSP body(similar to OSPF's DBD )
- exchanged only during initialization on P2P links
- sent periodically by DIS on bcast networks

* Receivers of CSNP packets can compare their link-state database contents to
 the list of LSPs in the CSNP and perform appropriate action—flood a newer or
 missing LSP if they have one, or request an LSP if they find it missing in
 their own database.

* If the sender’s link-state database contains so many LSPs that listing them
 all in a single CSNP packet would cause it to exceed the MTU, multiple CSNPs
 are sent. For this purpose, the individual LSPIDs to be advertised are first
 sorted as integer numbers in ascending order. Each CSNP contains information
 about the Start LSPID and End LSPID that is described by this CSNP. The full
 range of possible LSPIDs starts with the value of 0000.0000.0000.00-00 (the
 bold part is the System ID, the following octet is the Pseudonode ID, and the
 octet following the dash is the LSP Number ID), and ends with the value of
 FFFF.FFFF.FFFF.FF-FF. If all LSPs can be listed in a single CSNP, the Start
 and End LSPIDs will use these respective values. If it is necessary to send
 more CSNPs, the first CSNP will have the 0000.0000.0000.00-00 as the Start
 LSPID, and the End LSPID will be set to the LSPID of the last entry in this
 CSNP. In the following CSNPs, the Start and End LSPIDs will be set to the
 respective LSPIDs of the first and last entry, sorted in ascending order. The
 last CSNP will have the value of FFFF.FFFF.FFFF.FF-FF as the End LSPID. This
 sorting of LSPIDs into ascending number and CSNPs sequen- tially listing all
 LSPIDs from the allowable range are the reasons for calling these PDUs
 Sequence Numbers PDUs.





=== Partial Sequence Numbers PDU

- used to request an LSP or acknowledge its successful arrival.


== Network Types

- Broadcast (multi-access)
- P2P


=== Point-to-Point Links

- On point-to-point interfaces, IS-IS expects to detect a single neighbor, bring up an adja- cency, and then synchronize link-state databases.
- three-way handshake:
* configured with *isis three-way-handshake {cisco|ietf}*
* introduces Extended Local Circuit ID (4 octets)
* contains adjacency state TLV with

** Adjacency Three Way State: This is the state of adjacency as seen by the sending router.
** Extended Local Circuit ID: This is the ID of the sending router’s interface.
** Neighbor System ID: This value is set to the ID of the neighboring router whose IIHs have been successfully received.
** Neighbor Extended Local Circuit ID: This value is set to the Extended Local Circuit ID field value from the neighbor’s IIH packets.


* After the adjacency is declared as Up, routers will attempt to synchronize their link-state databases.

** Both routers will mark all their LSPs for flooding over the point-to-point link; plus they send CSNP packets to each other.
** Because the IS-IS standard assumes that the actual transmission of LSPs marked for flooding is driven by a periodically scheduled process,
   it is possible that the CSNP packets are exchanged before the LSP transmission takes place.
   If a router learns from the received CSNP that its neighbor already has an LSP that is scheduled to be sent,
   the router will unmark the LSP, removing it from the set of LSPs to be flooded.
   This way, only the LSPs missing from the neighbor’s database will be sent to it.
   In addition, if a router learns from the received CSNP that the neighbor has LSPs that are newer or unknown,
   it will request them using a PSNP packet. Note that neither of these is necessary,
   as both routers nonetheless initially set up all their LSPs to be flooded across the link, without the aid of CSNP or PSNP packets.
   The initial sending of CSNPs to com- pare the link-state databases and PSNPs to request missing or updated entries increases the resiliency of the synchronization process but is not strictly necessary: Without these packets,
   routers will simply exchange the full link-state database.


=== Broadcast Networks

- Routers must create adjacencies, synchronize their databases, and keep them synchronized
- on Ethernet networks,

* encapsulates IEEE 802.2 LLC frames to DSAP and SSAP set to 0xFE
* sends L1 packets to mcast 0180.c200.0014
* sends L2 packets to mcast 0180.c200.0015

- detects neighbors with IIH

.Task: Configure the IS-IS Priority
----
(config-if)# isis priority <0-255>
----
NOTE: Priority 0 doesn't exclude the router from the election


==== DIS

- helps routers on bcast segment to synchronize with periodic flooding of CSNPs
- represents the bcast segment as the pseudo-node
- doesn't elect/need backup DIS


- elected with each IIH based on Highest
  * Interface priority
  * SNPA
  * System ID: when SNPA are not comparable
  ** Frame Relay DLCI vs ATM VPI/VCI


== Areas



- it is  possible to configure up to three different NSAP addresses on an IS-IS
router in a single IS-IS instance, provided that the System ID in all NSAP
addresses is identical and the NSAP addresses differ only in their Area ID.

* A router with multiple NSAP addresses will nonetheless maintain only a single
link-state database, causing all configured areas to merge together. This
behavior is useful when splitting, joining, or renumbering areas.

* For example, when you are renumbering an area, all routers are first added a second NSAP
address with the new Area ID and then the old NSAP address is removed—without
causing any adjacencies between routers to flap.

* Similarly, when you are joining two areas, routers in an annexed area are given
the new NSAP with the same Area ID as the area into which they are being
joined, and afterward, the old NSAP is removed. Splitting an area again uses a
similar approach—first add the new NSAP address to all routers, and afterward,
remove the former NSAP address.


- L1 routers advertise directly connected networks
- L2 routerts advertise directly connected networks, + all other L1 networks in its own area


== Authentication

- authenticates IIH independently of LSP, CSNP and PSNP packets
- L1 routers must have the same L1 area password
- L2 routers must have the same L2 domain password

- If security is a major concern, different passwords for L1 IIH, L2 IIH, L1
non-IIH, and L2 non-IIH packets can be configured.

.Task: Configure IIH Authentication
----
(config-if)# isis authentication mode {text | md5} [level-1|level-2]
(config-if)# isis auth key-chain name [level-1|level-2]
----

.Task: Configure LSP, CSNP and PSNP Authentication
----
(config-router)# authentication mode {text | md5} [level-1|level-2]
(config-router)# authentication key-chain name [level-1|level-2]
----

NOTE: In the previous commands , if the *level-1* or *level-2*
keyword is omitted from a command where it is currently indicated, the
corresponding authentication type will be activated for both levels.


== IPv6 Support

- Supports out-of-the box
