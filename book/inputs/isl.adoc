= ISL

== Overview

- Inter-Switch Link
- Cisco proprietary
- Provides VLAN trunking
- Supports normal and extended VLANs
- Encapsulates the original header with 26-byte header
- Removes the header at the receiving end

== Frame

The ISL frame consists of three fields:
the ISL header( 26 bytes), the original frame and the FCS (4 bytes)

=== Field descriptions

DA—Destination Address::

- 40-bit
- Multicast address: "0100-0C00-00" or "0300-0C00-00".
- The first 40 bits of the DA field signal the receiver that the packet is in ISL format. ???

TYPE—Frame Type::
- 4 bits
- Indicates the type of the original frame
** 0000: 	Ethernet
** 0001: 	Token Ring
** 0010: 	FDDI
** 0011: 	ATM

USER—User Defined Bits (TYPE Extension)::
- 4 bits
- Extends the meaning of the TYPE field
- Default value: "0000"
- For Ethernet frames, the USER field bits "0" and "1" indicate the priority of the packet as
it passes through the switch. Whenever traffic can be handled in a manner that
allows it to be forwarded more quickly, the packets with this bit set should
take advantage of the quick path. It is not required that such paths be
provided.
+
** XX00 	Normal Priority
** XX01 	Priority 1
** XX10 	Priority 2
** XX11 	Highest Priority

SA—Source Address::

- 48 bits set to set MAC address of the switch port that transmits the frame.
- May be ignored by the receiving device

LEN—Length::

- 16 bits set to the length of the packet in bytes
with the exclusion of the DA, TYPE, USER, SA, LEN, and FCS fields.

AAAA03 (SNAP)—Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) and Logical Link Control (LLC)::

- 24 bits set to "0xAAAA03".

HSA—High Bits of Source Address::
- 24 bits set to 0x00-00-0C (Cisco OUI) of the SA field.

VLAN—Destination Virtual LAN ID::
- 15 bits set to the VLAN ID of the frame

BPDU—BPDU and CDP Indicator::
- 1 bit set when STP or CDP encapsulates an ISL packet

INDX—Index::
- 16 bits set to the port index of the source of the packet as it exits the switch
- Used for diagnostic purposes only
- May be ignored by the receiving bridge

RES—Reserved for Token Ring and FDDI::
- 16 bits used when Token Ring or FDDI packets are encapsulated with an ISL frame
* In the case of Token Ring frames, the Access Control (AC) and Frame Control (FC) fields are placed here.
* In the case of FDDI, the FC field is placed in the Least Significant Byte (LSB) of this field.
- For Ethernet packets, the RES field should be set to all zeros.

ENCAP FRAME—Encapsulated Frame::
- Encapsulated data packet with its own CRC value completely unmodified
- Length from 1 to 24575 bytes

FCS—Frame Check Sequence::
- 4 bytes set by the sending MAC and recalculated by the receiving bridge
- New FCS calculated over the entire ISL packet
