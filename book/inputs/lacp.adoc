= LACP

- IEEE 802.1ax, formely IEEE 802.3ad
- Automatic creation of port channels
- Multicast address IEEE 802.3 Slow Protocols: 0180-C200-0002
- EtherType value: 0x8809
- Timers: hellos every second during hand shake
- Maximum: 16 ports with max 8 active

== Restrictions

TODO


== Modes

Passive::
- Does not initiate LACP negotiation but responds to LACP packets
- Default mode

Active::
- Initiate LACP negotiation by sending LACP packets

On::
- Forces the interface to the channel without PAgP or LACP


Working Etherchannel for On-On, Passive-Active, Active-Active




== LACP Hot-Standby Ports

- Only 8 LACP links can be active at one time
- Any additional links are in hot-standby mode
- If one of the active links becomes inactive,
  a hot-standby link becomes active in its place

- Each link is assigned a unique priority in this order
  * LACP system priority (1..65535, default: 32768)
  * System ID ( the switch MAC address)
  * LACP port priority
  * Port number
- In priority comparisons, lower values have higher priority.

- To determine which ports are active and which ports are hot standby,
  * Select the master switch with a low system priority and system-id
  * Select the master ports with the low port priority and number.
    The port-priority and port-number of the slave switch are not used.

.Task: Check Which Ports Are In the Hot-Standby Mode
----
# show etherchannel summary
----

.Task: Configure the LACP System Priority
----
(config)# lacp system-priority <priority>
----
NOTE: The master switch on a port channel (with the lower system priority) is responsible 
for choosing which member interfaces are active in a port channel when there are more 
member interfaces than the max number of member interfaces associated with a port-channel interface.

.Task: Show the LACP System Priority
----
# show lacp sys-id
----

.Task: LACP Port Priority
----
(config-if)# lacp port-prioriy
----

.Task: Show LACP counters
----
# sh lacp counters

TODO actual result
----
NOTE: An interface should see the sent and received columns increment over time.
The failure of the counters to increment indicates a problem 
(physical link, incomplete/incompatible configuration with remote device )

# clear lacp counters

== LACP Fast

- send LACP packets every 1 second
  * instead of every 30 seconds in the original standard

.Task: Send LACP every 1 second
----
(config-if)# lacp rate fast
----

.Task: Send LACP every 30 second
----
(config-if)# lacp rate slow
----


.Task: Verify LACP speed rate
----
# sh lacp internal

== LACP Port-Channel MaxBundle Feature

- Control the number of ports allowed to be bundled into the etherchannel
- Allows hot-standby ports with fewer bundled ports

.Task: Configure the Maximum Number Of Bundled Ports Allowed In a LACP Port Channel
----
(config-if)# lacp max-bundle
----

== LACP Port-Channel Min-Links Feature

- Only for LACP Etherchannel
- Prevents low-bandwidth interface from becoming active
- Causes LACP etherChannels to become inactive if they have too few active members ports to supply the required minimum bandwith


.Task: Configure the Minimum Number Of Member Ports That Must Be In the Link-Up State and Bundled In the Etherchannel for the Port Channel Interface to Transition to the Link-Up State
----
(config-if)# port-channel min-link <number>
