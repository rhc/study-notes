- Cisco Location/ID Separation Protocol
- routing architecture and a data and control plane protocol created to address routing capability scalability problems
  * aggregation issues:
  * traffic engineering:
  * multihoming:
  * routing instability:
- can be used in data centers, campus networks, branches, next-gen WANs, SP cores
- can be used for mobility, network virtualization, IoT, IPv4-to-IPv6 transition, traffic engineering

- RFC 6830

- EID Endpoint Identifier: Endpoint IP address within a LISP site
- ITR Ingress tunnel router: LISP-encapsulates IP packets coming from EIDs that are destined outside the LISP site
- ETR Egress tunnel router: de-encapsulates LISP-encapsulated IP packets coming from sites outside the LISP and destined to EIDs within the LISP site.
- xTR tunnel router performs ITR and ETR functions.
- Proxy ITR: like ITR but for non-LISP sites that send traffic to EID destinations
- Proxy ETR: like ETR but for EID that send traffic to destinations at non-LISP sites
- Proxy xTR: performs PITR and PETR functions
- ALT: Alternative topology advertises EID prefixes in an  alternate BGP topology over GRE, including to the MR
- RLOC: Routing locator
  * IPv4 or IPv6 address of an ETR that is internet facing or network core facing
- MS Map server
  * learns EID-to-prefic mapping entries from an ETR
  * stores them in a local EID-to-RLOC mapping db
- MR Map resolver
  * receives LISP-encapsulated map requests from an ITR
  * finds the appropriate ETR to answer those requests by consulting the map server
- MS/MR map server/map resolver

== LISP routing architecture

- LISP separates IP addresses into EIDs and RLOCs.
  * Endpoints can roam from site to site
  * The only thing that changes is their RLOC, the EIDs remains the same

== LISP control plane

- operates like DNS
- resolves an EID into an RLOC by sending map requests to the MR
- scalable on-demand routing protocol because it is based on a pull model
  * only the needed routing information is requested
  * not all the routes to all routers including unnecessary ones

== LISP data plane

- ITRs performs IP-in-IP/UDP encapsulation
  * LISP-encapsulates IP packets received from EIDs in an outer IP UDP header with source and destination in the RLOC space
  * The original IP header and data are preserved => inner header
  * A LISP shim header is included between the outer UDP header and the inner header

== LISP packet flow

image::lisp-packet-flow.png[]

1. The source endpoint, at a remote site, performs a DNS lookup to find the destination.

2. Traffic is remote, so it has to go through the branch router,
which is a LISP-enabled device, in this scenario, playing the role of ITR.

3. The branch router does not know how to get to the specific address of the
destination. It is LISP-enabled, so it performs a LISP lookup to find a locator
address. Notice how the destination EID subnet (10.1.0.1/24) is associated to
the RLOCs (172.16.1.1 and 172.16.2.1) identifying both ETR devices at the data
center LISP-enabled site. Also, each entry has associated priority and weight
values that by the destination site controls to influence the way inbound
traffic is received from the transport infrastructure. The priority is used to
determine if both ETR devices can be used to receive LISP encapsulated traffic
that is destined to a local EID subnet (load-balancing scenario). The weight
allows tuning the amount of traffic that each ETR receives in a load-balancing
scenario (hence the weight configuration makes sense only when specifying equal
priorities for the local ETRs).

4. The ITR (branch router) performs an IP-in-IP encapsulation and transmits the
data out the appropriate interface based on standard IP routing decisions. The
destination is one of the RLOCs of the data center ETRs. Assuming the priority
and weight values are configured the same on the ETR devices (as the following
figure shows), the selection of the specific ETR RLOC is done on a per-flow
basis based on hashing that is performed on the Layer 3 and Layer 4 information
of the IP packet of the original client.

5. The receiving LISP-enabled router receives the packet, de-encapsulates the
packet, and forwards the packet to the final destination.


NOTE: In the current Cisco IOS and NX-OS LISP implementation,
the LISP control plane is triggered
if the lookup for the destination address produces
no results (no match)
or if the only available match is a default route.
