= MPLS

- Protocol number: 137 ???
- EtherType: 0x8847 unicast, 0x8848 multicast 
- packet-forwarding technology which uses labels in order to make data
  forwarding decisions
- LSP Label Switching Path
- FEC forwarding equivalence class: a group of IP packets which are forwarded
  in the same manner (e.g., over the same path, with the same forwarding
  treatment)

== MPLS Label Stack

digraph g {
  node[shape=record]
  node0 [label ="{Layer2 Header}|{Top Label}|{...}|{Bottom Label} |{Layer 3 Header}"];
}

.MPLS Header Format
[packetdiag, target='mpls-header-format']

{
  colwidth = 32
  node_height = 32
  default_node_color = lightyellow
  default_fontsize = 12

  * Label [len=20]
  * EXP [len=3]
  * S [len=1]
  * TTL [len=8]

}
----

Label:: Locally significant to the router
- 0 : IPv4 Explicit NULL Label. indicates that the label stack must be
  popped, and the packet forwarding must be based on the IPv4 header.
- 1 : Router Alert Label. When a received packet contains this label value
  at the top of the label stack, it is delivered to a local software module for
  processing. The actual packet forwarding is determined by the label beneath
  it in the stack. However, if the packet is forwarded further, the Router
  Alert Label should be pushed back onto the label stack before forwarding. The
  use of this label is analogous to the use of the Router Alert Option in IP
  packets (for example, ping with record route option)
- 2 : IPv6 Explicit NULL Label. indicates that the label stack must be
  popped, and the packet forwarding must be based on the IPv6 header
- 3 : Implicit NULL Label. never actually appears in the
  encapsulation.indicates that the LSR pops the top label from the stack and
  forwards the rest of the packet (labeled or unlabeled) through the outgoing
  interface (as per the entry in Lfib). Although this value might never appear
  in the encapsulation, it needs to be specified in the Label Distribution
  Protocol, so a value is reserved
- 4-15: Reserved

EXP:: Experimental, class of service
S:: Bottom-of-Stack flag
TTL:: Time to live

== MPLS ping and tracetroute


MPLS LSP ping uses MPLS echo request and reply packets to validate an LSP. You can use
MPLS LSP ping to validate IPv4 LDP, AToM, and IPv4 RSVP FECs by using appropriate
keywords and arguments with the ping mpls command. The MPLS echo request packet is sent
to a target router through the use of the appropriate label stack associated with the LSP to be
validated. Use of the label stack causes the packet to be forwarded over the LSP itself.
The destination IP address of the MPLS echo request packet is different from the address used
to select the label stack. The destination IP address is defined as a 127.x.y.z/8 address. The
127.x.y.z/8 address prevents the IP packet from being IP switched to its destination if the LSP is
broken.

An MPLS echo reply is sent in response to an MPLS echo request. The reply is sent as an IP
packet and it is forwarded using IP, MPLS, or a combination of both types of switching. The
source address of the MPLS echo reply packet is an address obtained from the router
generating the echo reply. The destination address is the source address of the router that
originated the MPLS echo request packet. The MPLS echo reply destination port is set to the
echo request source port.


MPLS LSP traceroute uses MPLS echo request and reply packets to validate an LSP. You can
use MPLS LSP traceroute to validate IPv4 LDP and IPv4 RSVP FECs by using appropriate
keywords and arguments with the trace mpls command.
The MPLS LSP Traceroute feature uses TTL settings to force expiration of the TTL along an
LSP. MPLS LSP Traceroute incrementally increases the TTL value in its MPLS echo requests
(TTL = 1, 2, 3, 4) to discover the downstream mapping of each successive hop. The success of
the LSP traceroute depends on the transit router processing the MPLS echo request when it
receives a labeled packet with a TTL = 1. On Cisco routers, when the TTL expires, the packet is
sent to the Route Processor (RP) for processing. The transit router returns an MPLS echo reply
containing information about the transit hop in response to the TTL-expired MPLS packet. The
MPLS echo reply destination port is set to the echo request source port.

== L3VPNs

- mpls vpn
**   CE : no mpls-aware
**   PE : mpls and vpn aware
**   P : no vpn aware


TODO Place this section at an appropriate place

- Establish an LSP between PEs: IGP + LDP , free BGP core
- Exchange routes with customer: PE-CE IGP or BGP
- Exchange customer routes between PEs: iBGP + MPLS VPN label
- Label switch between PEs: Data follows the IGP + LDP transport label

== IPv6 over MPLS: 6PE and 6VPE

- enables the service providers running an MPLS/IPv4 infrastructure
to offer IPv6 services without any major changesin the infrastructure

- benefits

  * Minimal operational cost and risk : No impact on existing IPv4 and MPLS services.
  * Only PE routers upgrade : A 6PE and 6VPE router can be an existing PE router or
  a new one dedicated to IPv6 traffic.
  * No impact on IPv6 CE routers : The ISP can connect to any CE router running Static,
  IGP or EGP.
  * Production services ready : An ISP can delegate IPv6 prefixes.
  * IPv6 introduction into an existing MPLS service : 6PE and 6VPE routers can be added at any time.
