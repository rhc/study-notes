= MQC

- Define a traffic class with *class map*
- Define PHB actions(marking, queuing, )  with *policy map*
- Attach the traffic policy to an interface with *service-policy*

- restrictions: maximum of 256 classes in a single policy map

== Traffic Class

A traffic class contains 3 major elts: a name, a series of *match* commands followed by *match-all* (default) or *match-any*

.Match Commands That Can Be Used with MQC

- match access-group
- match any
- match class-map
- match cos
- match destination-address mac
- match discard-class
- match [ip] dscp
- match field
- match fr-dlci
- match input-interface
- match ip rtp
- match mpls experimental
- match mpls experimental topmost
- match not  // add a note here
- match packet length
-
- etc

- Packets that do not explicitly match a defined class are considered to have matched a special class called *class-default*.

Command                                      : Purpose
random-detect discard-class                  : Configures the WRED parameters for a discard- class value for a class in a policy map.
random-detect discard-class-based            : Configures  WRED on the basis of the discard class value of a packet.
random-detect ecn                            : Enables explicit congestion notification (ECN).
random-detect exponential-weighting-constant : Configures the exponential weight factor for the average queue size calculation for the queue reserved for a class.
random-detect precedence                     : Configure the WRED parameters for a particular IP Precedence for a class policy in a policy map.
set atm-clp                                  : Sets the cell loss priority (CLP) bit when a policy map is configured.
set cos                                      : Sets the  Layer 2 class of service (CoS) value of an outgoing packet.
set discard-class                            : Marks a packet with a discard-class value.
set [ip] dscp                                : Marks a packet by setting the differentiated services code point (DSCP) value in the type of service (ToS) byte.
set fr-de                                    : Changes the discard eligible (DE) bit setting in the address field of a Frame Relay frame to 1 for all traffic leaving an interface.
set mpls experimental                        : Designates the value to which the  MPLS bits are set if the packets match the specified policy map.
set precedence                               : Sets the precedence value in the packet header.
set qos-group                                : Sets a  QoS group identifier (ID) that can be used later to classify packets.
shape                                        : Shapes traffic to the indicated bit rate according to the algorithm specified.
shape adaptive                               : Configures a Frame  Relay interface or a point-to- point subinterface to estimate the available bandwidth by backward explicit congestion notification (BECN) integration while trafficommand
shape fecn-adaptative                        : configures a Frame Relay interface to reflect FECN bits as BECN bits in Q.922 test response messages.
