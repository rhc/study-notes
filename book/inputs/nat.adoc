- https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1631.txt[RFC 1631: The IP Network Address Translator]

== Purpose

- IPv4 address conservation
- can be static, dynamic or pat


== Inside and Outside Address

Inside local address::
(Private) IP address that is assigned to a host on the inside network.
Inside global address::
Public IP address that represents one or more inside local IP addresses to the outside world.
Outside local address::
(Private) IP address of an outside host as it appears to the inside network.
Outside global address::
Public IP address assigned to a host on the outside network by the owner of the host.

.Task: Display NAT Translation Information
----
show ip nat translations [verbose]
show ip nat statistics
----

== Static NAT

- Statically correlates the same local host to the same public IP address.
- Does not conserve IP addresses.
- can be used to make an inside server reachable by internet clients

.Task: Configure Static Translation Of Inside Source Address
----
conf t
ip nat inside source static <local-ip> <global-ip>

interface <type number>
  ip address <ip-address> <mask> [secondary]
  ip nat inside

interface type number
  ip address <ip-address> <mask>
  ip nat outside
----

== Dynamic NAT Without PAT

- One local host uses an available public IP address in a pool.
- Does not conserve IP addresses.
- Timeout after period of nonuse

.Task: Configure Dynamic Translation Of Inside Source Address
----
ip nat pool <name> <start-ip> <end-ip> {netmask <mask> | prefix-length <length>}
access-list <acl> permit source [<w.i.l.d>]
ip nat inside source list <acl> pool <name>

interface <type number>
  ip address <ip-address> <mask>
  ip nat inside

interface <type number>
  ip address <ip-address> <mask>
  ip nat outside
----

.Task: Change Timeouts Value
----
ip nat translation <seconds>
ip nat translation udp-timeout <seconds>
ip nat translation dns-timeout <seconds>
ip nat translation tcp-timeout <seconds>
ip nat translation finrst-timeout <seconds>
ip nat translation icmp-timeout <seconds>
ip nat translation syn-timeout <seconds>
----

== PAT

- Like dynamic NAT but multiple local hosts share a single public address by multiplexing TCP/UDP ports.
- Conserves IP addresses.

== NAT for Overlapping Address

- Can be done with any of the first three types.
- Translates both source and destination addresses, instead of just the source (for packets going from
  enterprise to the Internet).



== TCP Load Distribution for NAT

- Round-robin allocation of a virtual host that coordinates load sharing among real hosts.

.Task: Allow Internal Users Access to the Internet
----
ip nat pool <name> <start-ip> <end-ip> {netmask netmask | prefix-length prefix-length}
access-list number permit a.b.c.d [e.f.g.h]
ip nat inside source list number pool name overload

interface type number
  ip address ip-address mask
  ip nat inside

interface type number
  ip address ip-address mask
  ip nat outside
end
----


== Overlapping Networks

Configure dynamic translation of overlapping networks if your IP addresses in the stub network are
legitimate IP addresses belonging to another network and you want to communicate with those hosts or
routers using dynamic translation.

.Task: Configure Overlapping Network
----
ip nat pool name start-ip end-ip {netmask netmask | prefix-length prefix-length}
access-list access-list-number permit source [source-wildcard]
ip nat outside source list access-list-number pool name

interface type number
  ip address ip-address mask
  ip nat inside

interface type number
  ip address ip-address mask
  ip nat outside
----

== Server TCP Load Balancing

----
ip nat pool name start-ip end-ip {netmask netmask | prefix-length prefix-length} type rotary
access-list access-list-number permit source [source-wildcard]
ip nat inside destination-list access-list-number pool name

interface type number
  ip address ip-address mask
  ip nat inside

interface type number
  ip address ip-address mask
  ip nat outside
----


.Task: Clear NAT Entries Before the Timeout
----
clear ip nat translation inside global-ip local-ip outside local-ip global-ip
clear ip nat translation outside global-ip local-i p
clear ip nat translation protocol inside global-ip global-port local-ip local-port outside local-ip local-port-global-ip global-port
clear ip nat translation {* | [forced] | [inside global-ip local-ip] [outside local-ip global-ip]}
----

.Task: Enable Syslog for Logging NAT Translations
----
ip nat log translations syslog
no logging console
----

== Policy NAT

TODO

- translation done only if specific conditions are met
- allows one socket (ip,tcp/udp port) to be translated into
  another socket based on source/destination of the traffic

== NVI

- TODO
- NAT virtual interface
- introduced in IOS 12.3(14)T
- not supported on IOS XE

----
access-list 10 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255
ip nat source list 10 interface e0/1 overload
int e0/0
  ip nat enable
int e0/1
  ip nat enable
----


NVI removes the requirements to configure an interface as either inside or
outside. Also, the NAT order of operations is slightly different with NVI.
Classic NAT first performs routing and then translates the addresses when
going from an inside interface to an outside interface, and vice versa when
traffic flow is reversed. NVI, however, performs routing, translation, and
then routing again. NVI performs the routing operation twice, before and
after translation, before forwarding the packet to an exit interface, and
the whole process is symmetrical. Because of the added routing step,
packets can flow from an inside to an inside interface, in classic NAT
terms, which would fail if classic NAT was used.
