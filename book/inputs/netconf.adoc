= NETCONF

- RFC 4741, 6241
- Uses YANG data models to communicate with network devices
- Runs over SSH, TLS, and SOAP
- Stores informations and configurations in datastores
- Uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) messages in XML

== Differences with SNMP

|===
| Feature                | SNMP | NETCONF

| resources              | OIDs | Paths
| Data models            | MIBs | YANG core models
| Data modeling language | SMI  | YANG
| Mgt operations         | SNMP | NETCONF
| Encoding               | BER  | XML JSON
| Transport stack        | UDP  | SSH/TCP

TODO: relations between netconf and YANG
- management information (definition) : CLI/YANG models
- management information (instantied/payload): XML-encoded content
- management services: NETCONF operations <edit-config> <get-config> <get>
- remote operations: NETCONF RPC <rpc> <rpc-reply> <rpc-error>
- Transport: TLS, SSH

== Transactions

- all or nothing
- no order of operations or sequencing within a transaction
  * no part of the configuration is done first
  * the configuration is deployed all at the same time
- processed in the same order every time on every device
- run in a parallel state and have no impact on each other
  * parallel transactions touching different areas of the configuration on a device do not interfere
  * no impact if the same transaction is run against multiple devices

== operations

|===
| NETCONF Operation | Description

| <get>           | retrieve running configuration and state information of the device
| <get-config>    | retrieve some or all of the configuration from a datastore
| <edit-config>   | Edit  a configuration datastore
| <copy-config>   | Replace an entire configuration data store with another
| <delete-config> | Delete the configuration
| <commit> | Copy the candidate data store to the running data store
| <lock> / <unlock> | Lock or unlock the entire configuration data store system
| <close-session> | Gracefully terminate the NETCONF session
| <kill-session> | Forcibly terminate the NETCONF session

== Configuration Data Store

- running:
- candidate: 
- startup:

NOTE: NETCONF runs on TCP port 830 in Cisco IOS-XE
