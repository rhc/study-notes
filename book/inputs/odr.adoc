- provides IP routing for stub sites, with minimum cost
- uses CDP
  * to advertise connected IPv4 routes of a stub router to the hub
  * to advertise default IPv4 default route back to the spokes
  * ODR receives periodic CDP updates containing IP prefix information
- no IP routing protocol on the stub router
- hub router sends default route information to the stub router
- hub router populates the RIV with ODR routes learned from stub routers
  * the ip next hop for ODR routes is the IP address of the neighboring router as advertised throug CDP



.Task: Enable ODR on a hub router
----
(config)# router odr
----
IMPORTANT: do not forget to *cdp enable* on the hub and the spokes


.Task: Filter ODR information
----
(config-router)# distribute-list [<acl>| [route-map <map-tag>] ] in [<interface-type> | <interface-number>]
