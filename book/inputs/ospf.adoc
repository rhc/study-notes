== Neighbors

To form adjacency neighbors must agree on

- unique router ID
- unique interface IP address
  * primary IP address for OSPFv2
  * link-local address for OSPFv3
- common attributes
  * interface area-id
  * authentication
  * hello and dead timers
  * area type (normal, stub, NSSA, )
  * interface MTU
  * other optional capabilities

== Router Id

Determined by these rules in order of preference at boot or ospf process restart:

- manually configured router id
- highest IP address of an up/up loopback not used by other OSPF process
- highest IP address of an up/up non-loopack interfaces  not used by other OSPF process

.Task: Set the Router-Id
----

== DR Election

- There is no pre-emption in OSPF
  * Router must wait for the failure of the current DR
  * Use the WAIT timer = DEAD timer

- on hub-and-spoke, best practice is to have hub as DR and spokes not eligible as DR with priority=0

=== Database Description Packet


- Uses an OSPF-defined simple error-recovery process.

* Each DD packet, which can contain several LSA headers, has a sequence number assigned.
* The receiver acknowledges a received DD packet by sending a DD packet with the identical sequence number back to the sender.
* The sender uses a window size of one packet and then waits for the acknowledgment before sending the next DD packet.

- Only the master is allowed to send DD packets on its own accord as well as to set and increase their sequence numbers.
- A slave is allowed to send a DD packet only as a response to a DD packet received from master router, and must use the
same sequence number. In effect, a slave is polled by the master and only responds to it.
* If a slave has more DD than the master, he uses the M flag

LSA headers:: Contains LSA headers to identify the LSAs acknowledged.

=== Link-State Packets

- only a router that has originated a particular LSA is allowed to modify it or withdraw it.
* Other routers must process and flood this LSA within its defined flooding scope if they recognize the LSAâ€™s type and contents,
  but they must not ever change its contents, block it, or drop it before its maximum lifetime has expired.
- has a unique LSID (Link State Identifier)

[horizontal]

Type 1:: Router LSA
  - one per router per area
  - lists the RouterID,  the IP Addresses and neighbors for each interface in that area
  - represents Stub networks (subnet on which a router has not formed any neighbor relationships )
  - flooded only within the same area
  - LSID = Router ID

Type 2::  Network LSA
  - one per transit network
  * network over which two or more OSPF routers have become neighors and elected a DR
    so that traffic can transit between them
  * except for point-to-point connection treated as a combination of p2p link and a stub IP network
    (to facilate unnumbered p2p links)
  - generated by DR
  - describes the set of routers attached to a particular network
  - describes the subnet and the router interfaces connected to the subnet
  - flooded only within the area that contains the network
  - LSID = DR's interface IP Address on that subnet


Type 3:: Summary inter-area LSA
  - Generated by ABR
  - describes inter-area routes to network
  * represents networks present in one area when being advertised into another area.
  * Defines the subnets in the origin area, and cost, but no topology data.
  - Flooded only within its area of origin; reoriginated on ABRs.


Type 4:: Summary inter-area LSA
  - Generated by ABR
  - Flooded by ABR to all areas except the area containing the ASBR
  - describes routes to ASBR
  * tells other routers in the area how to get to the advertising router of an external route
  - Flooded all areas except the area containing the ASBR

Type 5:: AS external LSA
  - originated by ASBR
  - describes routes to destinations external to the AS
  - flooded all over except stub areas

Type 6:: Group Membership LSA
  - defined for MOSPF
  - Not supported by Cisco

Type 7:: NSSA External LSA
  - Created by ASBRs inside an NSSA, instead of a type 5 LSA.
  - Flooded only within its area of origin;
  - converted to type 5 LSA on an ABR toward other areas.

Type 8:: External Attributes LSA
  - Created by ASBRs during BGP-to-OSPF redistribution to preserve BGP attributes of redistributed networks.
  - Not implemented in Cisco routers


Type 9-11:: Opaque LSA
  - Used as generic LSAs to allow for easy future extension of OSPF;
    * for example, type 10 has been adapted for MPLS traffic engineering.
  - have different flooding scope:
    * Type 9 has link-local flooding scope,
    * type 10 has area-local flooding scope,
    * type 11 has autonomous system flooding scope equivalent to the flooding scope of type 5 LSAs
    (not flooded into stubby areas and NSSAs).

. OSPF'S SPF Algorithm Links Different Pieces Of Information Together.
****
For a router in Area 1 to reach the external route in Area 3,
it has to look at the Type-5 that represents the external route.
Then it has to look at the Type-4 representing the ABR on the area that the ASBR lives in.
Then we have to look at the Type-3 to get to that remote ABR.
Finally we look at the Type-1 and Type-2 LSAs in our area to determine how to get to our closest ABR.

== Backbone

ABR:: Router actively connected to multiple areas *including* Area 0
* has one LSDB for each area
* runs the SPF for each LSDB then combines the result in a single routing table
* can summarize and filter routes
* ignores type 3 LSAs learned in a nonbackbone area during SPF calculation,
  which prevents an ABR from choosing a route that goes into a nonbackbone area and then back into the backbone.

  - no DR/BDR election
  - multicast hellos every 10 seconds
  - default for HDLC and PPP

Non-broadcast::
  - unicast hellos every 30 seconds

Point-to-multipoint::
  - multi-access, broadcast
  - hellos every 30 seconds
  - automatic discovery of neighbor (MA)
  - DR/BDR election
  - one IP subnet
  - maintain connectivity during a VC failure ???
  - generates host routes (with mask /32 ) for each neighbor

== Summarization

Why the null 0 interface is added ?

- do prevent routing loops
  * packets destined for the routes that have been summarized will a longer  match
  * packets destined to summary routes will be dropped


See good explanation


== OSPF States

image::ospf-lsdb-exchange.png[OSPF LSDB Exchange]

Down::
- No hellos have been received from neighbors

Attempt::
- Unicast hello packet has been sent to neighbor, but not yet received back
- only used for manually configured NBMA neighbors

Init::
- I have received a hello packet from a neighbor,
but they have not acknowledged a hello from me

2-way::
- I have received a hello packet from a neighbor
and he acknowledged a hello from me
- I can see my Router Id in the neighbor's hello packet
- Stop here for DROthers


Exstart::
- Master & slave relationship is formed where master has higher Router-id
- Master chooses the starting sequence number of the DBD packets that are
  used for actual LSA exchange.




Exchange::
- Local link state database is sent through DBD packets
- DBD sequence number is used for reliable acknowledgement/retransmission

Loading::
- LSR packets are sent to ask for more info about a particular LSA

Full::
- Neighbors are fully adjacent and databases are synchronized.


.Key Point
****
In the beginning of the exchange, each router places the other into the
ExStart state. Each of them considers itself to be the master, and sends an
empty DD packet to the other router, containing a randomly chosen sequence
number, and MS (Master), M (More), and I (Init) flags set to 1. After receiving
the neighborâ€™s DD packet, however, the router with the lower RID will change
its role to slave, and it will respond with a DD packet with MS and I flags
cleared and the sequence number set to the sequence number of masterâ€™s DD
packet. This accomplishes the master/slave selection, and both routers move to
the Exchange state. The master will then send a DD packet with the sequence
number incre- mented by 1, optionally containing one or more LSA headers, and
the slave will respond with a DD packet reusing the same sequence number from
the received packet, optionally advertising its own LSA headers. The exchange
continues in the same fashion, with the master incrementing the sequence number
of each subsequent DD packet, until both routers have advertised all known all
LSA headers (the master will stop sending DD pack- ets when it has advertised
all LSA headers itself and the last DD response from the slave has the M flag
cleared).

----

.Key Rollover Procedure with Multiple MD5 Keys
[NOTE]
====
Multiple MD5 keys with different key IDs are allowed per interface.
This allows for graceful key migration where a new key can be added without disrupting the adjacencies.

- To sign sent packets, it always uses the key that was added as the last one to the interface (regardless of the key number).
- To authenticate the received packet, it uses the key ID that is indicated in the packet.
- If a neighbor is detected on an interface that uses a different key number than this router,
  OSPF enters a key migration phase in which it sends all packets as many times as how many keys are configured on the interface,
  and each packet is signed with a different key.
- The migration phase ends when all neighbors have migrated to the same key as the one used to sign sent packets by this router.
- This procedure is also called the OSPF key rollover procedure.
- Because plaintext passwords do not have key numbers, the key rollover is not available for plaintext authentication.
====

=== Extended Cryptographic OSPF Authentication

- Uses SHA-HMAC (Secure Hash Algorithm - Hash Message Authentication Code) as per RFC 5709
- Uses key chains

*  Each key in the key chain must have a cryptographic algorithm
  configured using a per-key *cryptographic-algorithm* command.
  Failure to do so will result in OSPF not using that key.
*  Each key in a key chain can be configured with the *send-life-time* and
   accept-life-time keywords to limit its usability to a particular timeframe.
   If multiple keys in the key chain are eligible to sign egress packets, the
   key with the highest key ID will be used. Be aware that this behavior
   differs from RIPv2 and EIGRP that select the key with the lowest key ID.
*  The key rollover procedure as used by classic OSPF is not used with key
   chains.  There is no key migration phase of sending multiple OSPF packets signed with different valid
   keys.

   ** To sign egress packets, use the valid key with the highest key ID in the key chain.
   ** To authenticate ingress packets, try to use the key indicated in the received packet.

== TTL Security Check


- Drops packets with TTL < 255 except on virtual links and sham links
* If all OSPF routers sent their packets with TTL set to 255,
  receiving an OSPF packet with its TTL less than 255 would be a clear indication that the packet originated
  outside the network segment over which it was received.
  Because OSPF com munication is, with the notable exception of virtual links and sham links,
  always based on direct router-to-router communication, receiving an OSPF
  packet outside a virtual link or a sham link with its TTL less than 255 is a
  possible indication of a malicious activity.

=== SPF Throttling

- Defines a variable-length wait interval between two consecutive SPF runs
- Controls by 3 parameters:

  * spf-start: initial wait interval before an SPF computation, if the network has been stable for a prolonged period of time.
  * spf-hold: wait time between subsequent SPF runs, and its value doubles for each consecutive SPF run.
  * spf-max-wait:  maximum time between two SPF runs (that is, doubling the spf-hold value is capped at spf-max-wait), and also
  defines a period during which the network must be stable for the wait interval to be set back to spf-start and the spf-hold to its preconfigured
  value. If the network has been stable for the last spf-hold period but not for the entire spf-max-wait since the last SPF run, the wait interval returns
  to the spf-start value but the subsequent wait will still be set to twice the
  previous spfhold value.

 Minimum hold time for LSA throttle 15000 msecs
 Maximum wait time for LSA throttle 100000 msecs
 Minimum LSA arrival 1000 msecs
 LSA group pacing timer 240 secs
----

TODO
Apart from throttling the LSA origination, a router can also be configured to
ignore the same LSA upon arrival if it appears to arrive too often. This
throttling of arriving LSAs is configured using the timers lsa arrival
milliseconds OSPF command. If two or more same LSAs arrive less than
milliseconds apart, only the first one is accepted and the remaining LSAs are
dropped. In effect, the same LSA is accepted only if it arrives more than
milliseconds after the previous accepted one. The default setting is 1000
millisec- onds and can be seen in the show ip ospf output in Example 9-16.
Obviously, the value of the minimum LSA arrival interval should be smaller than
the neighborsâ€™ initial hold interval in LSA Throttling. Otherwise, a neighbor
would be allowed to send an updated LSA sooner than this router would be
willing to accept it.

== OSPF Filtering

=== Routes Filtering Not LSA Filtering

- uses *distribute-list*

-  The distribute list in the inbound direction applies to results of SPFâ€”the
   routes to be installed into the routerâ€™s routing table.
-  The distribute list in the outbound direction applies only to redistributed
   routes and only on an ASBR; it selects which redistributed routes shall be
   advertised.
-  The inbound logic does not filter inbound LSAs; it instead filters the
   routes that SPF chooses to add to that one routerâ€™s routing table.
-  If the distribute list includes the incoming interface parameter, the
   incoming interface is checked as if it were the outgoing interface of the
   route.


=== ABR Type 3 LSA Filtering

-  allows an ABR to filter type 3 LSAs at the point where the LSAs would normally
 be created.

 packet to yet another router.
