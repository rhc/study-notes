= OSPFv3

- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5340[RFC 5340 OSPF for IPv6]

- multicast FF02::5, FF02::6

== Concepts

- Type 1 : router LSA do not advertise prefixes.
- Type 9 : intra-area-prefix LASA advertise prefixes.


=== LS Type 

- 16 bits 
- indicates what type of LSA it is and how far the LSA should be flooded

  * U bit (understand )
    ** first bit
    ** indicates how the LSA should be handled by a router that does not understand the LSA function code field.
    ** value 0 to flood the LSA only on the local link
    ** value 1 to store and flood the LSA as if the router understand the LSA type

  * S2, S1 (second and third bit)
