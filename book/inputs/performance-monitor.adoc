= Performance Monitor

TODO

Cisco performance monitor enables you to monitor the flow of packets in your
network and become aware of any issues that might impact the flow before it
starts to significantly impact the performance of the application in question.
Performance monitoring is especially important for video traffic because high
quality interactive video traffic is highly sensitive to network conditions
(such as packet drops). Even minor issues that may not affect other
applications can have dramatic effects on video quality.
