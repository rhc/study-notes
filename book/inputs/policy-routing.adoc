= Policy Based Routing




Policy routing allows the router to forward traffic based on
user-defined criteria without even consulting the IP routing
table.
The Policy-Based Routing feature is a process whereby a device puts packets
through a route map before routing the packets. The route map determines which
packets are routed next to which device.

----
(config-if)# ip policy route-map <name>
----


match length
match ip address

.task: Specify where to output packets that pass a match clause of a route map for policy routing
----
(config-route-map)# set ip next-hop {<ip-address>[...<ip-address>]
                                    | dynamic dhcp
                                    | encapsulate l3vpn <profile-name>
                                    | peer-address
                                    | recursive [global | vrf <vrf-name>] <ip-address>
                                    | verify-availability [ <ip-address> <sequence> track <track-object-number>]}

== Local Policy

Local policy routing is similar in operation to normal policy
routing, except that it affects locally generated traffic from
the router instead of traffic transiting the router, like
received inbound on an interface.
