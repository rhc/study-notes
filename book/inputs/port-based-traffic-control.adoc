= Port-Based Traffic Control

== Storm Control

- limits the amount of broadcast, multicast or unicast traffic received inbound on a physical interface.
- blocks the port when the rising threshold is reached
- resumes normal forwards when the traffic rate drops below falling threshold
- the threshold can be expressed in
  ** pps (packet per second)
  ** bps (bits per seconds)
  ** pps for small frames (< 67 bytes)
  ** percentage of the available bandwidth of the port
- by default, filters outs the traffic and err-disable the port
- can be configured to send a SNMP trap
- supports only physical ports
  ** the configuration commands are available on EtherChannel interfaces, but they have no effect

== Port Blocking

- blocks a port from flooding unknown unicast or multicast to other ports

.Task: Block unknown multicast forwarding out of the port
----
(config-if)# switchport block multicast
----
[NOTE]
====
- Only pure L2 multicast traffic is blocked
- multicast packets that contain IPv4 or IPv6 information in the header are not blocked
====

.Task: Block unknown unicast forwarding out of the port
----
(config-if)# switchport block unicast
----
