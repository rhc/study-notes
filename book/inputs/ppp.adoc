- error detection, error recovery, standard protocol Type field, supports synchronous and asynchronous links
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1661[RFC 1661]
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1662[RFC 1662]

== PPP Frame Format

- Replaces proprietary type with standard protocol
- Adds padding so the frame has even number of bytes

image::ppp-vs-hdlc.png[PPP vs HDLC]

- FCS:: Frame Checksum calculated over the address, control, protocol, information and payload fields

== PPP LCP

- link control protocol
- controls features independent of any Layer 3 protocol
- establishes a PPP sesion between 2 link partners.


.Task: Configure PPP
----
(config-if)# encapsulation ppp
----

=== LCP Operations:

  When a PPP serial link first comes up—for example, when a router senses the
  Clear to Send (CTS), Data Send Read (DSR), and Data Carrier Detect (DCD) leads
  come up at the physical layer—LCP begins parameter negotiation with the other
  end of the link. For example, LCP controls the negotiation of which
  authentication methods to attempt, and in what order, and then allows the
  authentication protocol (for example, CHAP)
  to complete its work. After all LCP negotiation has completed
  successfully, LCP is considered to be “up.”

=== LCP Features

- LQM link quality monitoring: drop if % of error frames above a configured value
- looped link detection: drop link if a router receives its own randomly chosen magic number
- layer 2 load balancing: fragment frames over multilink PPP
- authentication: chap, pap

.Configuration
- minimal with *encapsulation ppp*
- optional authentication, quality

----
(config-if)# encapsulation ppp
(config-if)# ppp quality <percent>
(config-if)# ppp authentication {chap | pap}
----


.Task: Drop the Link If Router Receives Its Own Magic Number
----

----


==== LQM


- When LQM is enabled, every keepalive period is sent to Link Quality Reports
(LQRs) in place of keepalives. All incoming keepalives are responded to
properly.
- If LQM is not configured, keepalives are sent every keepalive period and all incoming LQRs are responded to with an LQR.
- LQM is incompatible with Multilink PPP

.Task: Monitor PPP Link Quality
----
(config-if)# ppp quality <percent>
----

== Multilink PPP

- originally intended to combine multiple ISDN B-channels without requiring any Layer 3 load balancing
- now load balance traffic accross any type of point-to-point serial link
- configuration with multilink interfaces or virtual templates
- fragmenting each data link layer frame, either based on the number of parallel links or on a configured fragmentation delay.
* sends the fragments over different links at the same time.
* adds a header (4 or 2 bytes for Sequence Number and Flags bit) to allow reassembly on the receiving end

// add example



=== LFI

 - LFI (link fragmentation and interleaving )
 - prevents small, delay sensitive packets from having to wait on longer, delay-insensitive packets to be completely serialized out an interface.
 - the queuing scheduler generally LLQ on the multilink interface determines the next packet to send:

.Task: Allow Interleave
----
(config-if)# ppp multilink interleave
----

.Task: Define LFI Fragment Size
----
(config-if)# ppp multilink fragment-delay <microseconds>
----
NOTE: defines the fragment size based on stem:["Size" = x * "Bandwidth"]

.Example
----
interface Multilink1
  bandwidth 256
  ip address 10.1.34.3 255.255.255.0
  encapsulation ppp
  ppp multilink
  ppp multilink group 1
  ppp multilink fragment-delay 10
  ppp multilink interleave
  service-policy output queue-on-dsc

== PPP Compression

- uses L2 payload compression ( ip + tcp + data + DL) : best with longer packet
- TCP header compression ( ip + tcp )
- RTP header compression (ip + udp + rtp)

- payload compression works best with longer packets, and header with shorter packets
- header compression : achieves better compression ration 10:1 to 20:1

=== Layer 2 Compression

- options: LZS (Lempel-Ziv Stacker), MPPC (microsoft point-to-point compression), Predictor
- LZS use more CPU and less RAM than Predictor algorithm and have better compression ratio

- stacker: supports HDLC, PPP, FR, ATM
- mppc: PPP, ATM
- predictor: PPP, ATM

- configuration with a matching *compress* command under each interface on both end of the links
- once configured, ppp starts ccp (compression control protocol) which is another NCP

=== Header Compression

- configured with legacy commands or MQC commands
- legacy under the serial (ppp) or multilink interface
  - *ip tcp header-compression [passive]*
  - *ip rtp header-compression [passive]*

- add also MQC commands

// add examples


== PPP Authentication


.Task: Enable PPP Authentication
----
ppp authentication {chap | chap pap | pap chap | pap} [if-needed] [<list-name> | default] [callin]
----

.Task: Debug Ppp Authentication
----
debug ppp authentication
