= PPPoE


 - used for digital subscriber line (DSL) Internet access 
 because the public telephone network uses ATM for its transport protocol;
 therefore, Ethernet frames must be encapsulated in a protocol supported over both Ethernet and ATM.  

-  The PPP Client feature permits a Cisco IOS router, rather than an endpoint host, to serve as the client
 in a network. This permits multiple hosts to connect over a single PPPoE connection.

 - In a DSL environment, PPP interface IP addresses are derived from an upstream DHCP server
 using IP Configuration Protocol (IPCP). Therefore, IP address negotiation must be enabled on the
 routerâ€™s dialer interface. This is done using the ip address negotiated command in the dialer
 interface configuration.

 - Because of the 8-byte PPP header, the MTU for PPPoE is usually set to 1492 bytes so that the
 entire encapsulated frame fits within the 1500-byte Ethernet frame. A maximum transmission unit
 (MTU) mismatch prevents a PPPoE connection from coming up. Checking the MTU setting is a
 good first step when troubleshooting PPPoE connections.
