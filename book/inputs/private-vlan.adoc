- Separates ports as if they are on different VLAN while consuming only one subset.
- Typically used by service provider in a multi-tenant offerings: one router, one switch, multiple customers
- PVLAN
  * one primary VLAN (promiscuous ports) + multiple secondary VLANs
  * At most one isolated secondary VLAN
  * Zero or more community secondary VLANs
- Cannot use vlan 1, 1002-1005 as private vlans

== Primary VLANs

- carries unidirectional traffic downstream from promiscuous ports to all ports

.Task: Configure Primary VLAN and Associated Secondary VLANs

(config)# vtp mode transparent

== Isolated VLANs

- carries unidirectional traffic upstream from the hosts toward the promiscuous
  ports and the gateway.

.Task: Configure Isolated VLANs
----
(config)# vtp mode transparent
(config)# vlan 102

----

== Community VLANs

- carries unidirectional traffic upstream from the hosts toward the promiscuous
  ports and the gateway.

[NOTE]
====
Although private VLANs provide host isolation at Layer 2,
hosts can communicate with each other at Layer 3.

== Private-VLAN SVI

- SVI can only be associated to primary VLANs
- SVIs for secondary VLANs are inactive
- If you assign an IP subnet to the primary VLAN SVI,
this subnet is the IP subnet address of the entire private VLAN

== Private-Vlan Accross Multiple Switches


image:private-vlan-accross-multiple-switches.png[Private-VLAN accross multiple switches, 400, 400, float='left']

As with regular VLANs, private VLANs can span multiple switches. A trunk port
carries the primary VLAN and secondary VLANs to a neighboring switch. The trunk
port treats the private VLAN as any other VLAN. A feature of private VLANs
across multiple switches is that traffic from an isolated port in switch A does
not reach an isolated port on Switch B.


[WARNING]
====
- Manually configure private VLANs on all switches because VTP (v1 and v2) does not support private VLANs,
-
====

TODO interaction with switch that do not support private-vlan

TODO PVLAN Trunk

TODO PVLAN Isolated

TODO see page 67 Narbick


== Interaction with Other Features

VTP::
- VTP v1 and v2 don't propagate private-vlans
  ** Set transparent mode
  ** Save the VTP transparent mode and private-vlan to startup configuration
- VTP v3 supports private-vlans

STP::
- only one STP instance for the entire private-vlan
- the STP parameters of the primary VLAN are propagated to the secondary VLANs
- Enable Port Fast and BPDU guard on isolated and community host ports
  to prevent STP loops due to misconfigurations and to speed up STP convergence
- Do not enable Port Fast and BPDU guard on promiscuous ports.

DHCP snooping::
- Can be enabled on the private VLAN
- propagates to all secondary vlans when enabled on the primary VLAN
- If you configure DHCP on a secondary VLAN, the configuration does not take
  effect if the primary VLAN is already configured (?!)

IP source guard::
- enabled only if DHCP snooping is enabled on the primary vlan

SPAN::
- You can configure a private-VLAN port as a SPAN source port.
- You can use VLAN-based SPAN (VSPAN) on primary, isolated, and community VLANs
  or use SPAN on only one VLAN to separately monitor egress or ingress traffic.
- A private-VLAN host or promiscuous port cannot be a SPAN destination port. If
  you configure a SPAN destination port as a private-VLAN port, the port
  becomes inactive.
- A RSPAN vlan can not be a private-vlan primary or secondary vlan.


PAgP or LACP ::
- If a port is part of a private vlan, any Etherchannel configuration is inactive

IGMP snooping::
- When enabled (the default), the switch supports no more than 20 private-vlan domain

802.1x::
- You can configure IEEE 802.1x port-based authentication on a private-VLAN port,
- You can not configure IEEE 802.1x with port security, voice VLAN, or per-user
ACL on private-VLAN ports.

Static MAC address::
- If you configure a static MAC address on a promiscuous port in the primary VLAN,
  you must add the same static address to all associated secondary VLANs.
- If you configure a static MAC address on a host port in a secondary VLAN,
  you must add the same static MAC address to the associated primary VLAN.
- When you delete a static MAC address from a private-VLAN port,
  you must remove all instances of the configured MAC address from the private VLAN.

== PVLAN Edge or Protected Ports

- only local significance to the switch (unlike Private Vlans),
- no isolation provided between two protected ports located on different switches.
- A protected port does not forward any traffic (unicast, multicast, or broadcast) to any other
port that is also a protected port in the same switch.
- Traffic cannot be forwarded between protected ports at L2, all traffic passing between protected
 ports must be forwarded through a Layer 3 device.
