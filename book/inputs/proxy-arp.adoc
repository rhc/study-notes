  When the router needs to route a packet which matches an entry in the routing
  table with a next-hop value, it performs Layer 3 to Layer 2 resolution for the
  next-hop address. If it matches an entry in the routing table with just the
  outgoing/exit local interface, without a next-hop value, it performs Layer 3 to
  Layer 2 resolution for the final destination of the IP packet.
