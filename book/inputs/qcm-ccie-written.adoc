        3.   Which of the following commands must be configured on a Cisco IOS switch interface to
             disable Ethernet auto-negotiation?
              a.   no auto-negotiate
             b.    no auto
              c.   Both speed and duplex
             d.    duplex
              e.   speed
        4.   Consider an Ethernet cross-over cable between two 10/100 ports on Cisco switches. One
             switch has been configured for 100-Mbps full duplex. Which of the following is true about
             the other switch?
              a.   It will use a speed of 10 Mbps.
             b.    It will use a speed of 100 Mbps.
              c.   It will use a duplex setting of half duplex.
             d.    It will use a duplex setting of full duplex.

5.   Consider an Ethernet cross-over cable between two 10/100/1000 ports on Cisco switches.
     One switch has been configured for half duplex, and the other for full duplex. The ports
     successfully negotiate a speed of 1 Gbps. Which of the following could occur as a result of
     the duplex mismatch?
      a.   No frames can be received by the half-duplex switch without it believing an FCS error
           has occurred.
     b.    CDP would detect the mismatch and change the full-duplex switch to half duplex.
      c.   CDP would detect the mismatch and issue a log message to that effect.
     d.    The half-duplex switch will erroneously believe collisions have occurred.
6.   Which of the following Ethernet header type fields is a 2-byte field?
      a.   DSAP
     b.    Type (in SNAP header)
      c.   Type (in Ethernet V2 header)
     d.    LLC Control
7.   Which of the following standards defines a Fast Ethernet standard?
      a.   IEEE 802.1Q
     b.    IEEE 802.3U
      c.   IEEE 802.1X
     d.    IEEE 802.3Z
      e.   IEEE 802.3AB
      f.   IEEE 802.1AD
8.   Suppose a brand-new Cisco IOS–based switch has just been taken out of the box and cabled
     to several devices. One of the devices sends a frame. For which of the following destinations
     would a switch flood the frames out all ports (except the port upon which the frame was
     received)?
      a.   Broadcasts
     b.    Unknown unicasts
      c.   Known unicasts
     d.    Multicasts
9.   Which of the following configuration issues will keep a SPAN session from becoming active?
      a.   Misconfigured destination port
     b.    Destination port configured as a trunk
      c.   Destination port shutdown
     d.    Source port configured as a trunk



       10.   Which of the following are rules for SPAN configuration?
             a.    SPAN source and destination ports must be configured for the same speed and duplex.
             b.    If the SPAN source port is configured for 100 Mbps, the destination port must be config-
                   ured for 100 Mbps or more.
              c.   In a SPAN session, sources must consist of either physical interfaces or VLANs, but not
                   a mix of these.
             d.    Remote SPAN VLANs must be in the range of VLAN 1–66.
             e.    Only three SPAN sessions may be configured on one switch.
