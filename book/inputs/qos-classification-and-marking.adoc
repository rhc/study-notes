= Classification And Marking

== Fields that can be marked for QoS purposes

- Layer 3:  IPP, IP DSCP, DS field, ToS byte
- Layer 2:  Ethernet CoS,Frame Relay  DE, ATM CLP, MPLS EXP

===  IPP

image::ipp-vs-dscp.png[]

.IPP and Class Selector DSCP values
:===
DSCP CS name : IPP names

CS0/Default  : routine
CS1          : priority
CS2          : immediate
CS3          : flash
CS4          : flash override
CS5          : critical
CS6          : internetwork control
CS7          : network control
:===

=== DSCP

- PHB: Per-Hop Behavior

- Expedited Forwarding (EF):
* Queue EF packets so that they get scheduled quickly, to give them low latency.
* Police the EF packets so that they do not consume all bandwidth on the link or starve other queues.
* Binary value: 101110 Decimal value: 46

* packets given queue priority

- Assured Forwarding (AF)
* defines 4 queues with 3 drop priorities
* stem:[AFx_1y_1 > AFx_2y_2 if x_1 > x_2 or (x_1 = x_2 and y_1 < y_2)]
* AFxy -> 8x + 2y = decimal value


=== Ethernet LAN Class of Service

=== WAN

- Frame Relay DE (Discard Eligibility), 1-bit
- ATM CLP (Cell Loss Priority ), 1-bit
- MPLS EXP (Exprimental), 3-bit

== NBAR

- Network-Based Application Recognition
- Deep-packet classification  from Layer 4 through Layer 7:

* Statically assigned TCP and UDP port numbers.
* Non-TCP and non-UDP IP protocols.
* Dynamically assigned TCP and UDP port numbers.
  ** requires stateful inspection: inspect a protocol across multiple packets during packet classification.
* Subport classification or classification based on deep-packet inspection.
  ** URL, Hostname, or MIME type

- uses MQC match protocol

== CB Marking

- requires CEF
- Mark as close to the ingress edge of the network as possible, but not so close
to the edge that the marking is made by an untrusted device.



For any class inside the policy map for which there is no set command, packets in that class are not marked.


.Recommended Values for Traffic Marking
:===
Traffic Type              : IP Precedence : IP DSCP        : Class of Service
Voice payload             : 5             : EF             : 5
Video payload             : 4             : AF41           : 4

== QoS Pre-Classification


- enabled on VPN endpoint routers permit the router to make egress QoS decisions based on the original traffic,
before encapsulation, rather than just the encapsulating tunnel header.
- works by keeping the original, unencrypted traffic in memory until the egress QoS actions are taken.
- enables in tunnel interface configuration mode, virtual-template configuration mode, or crypto map configuration mode

.Task: Enable QoS pre-classification
----
(config-if)# qos pre-classification
----


== AutoQoS

- macro that helps automate class-based QoS configuration.
- creates and applies QoS configurations based on Cisco best-practice recommendations.
- provides the following benefits:

* Simpler QoS deployment.
* Less operator error, because most steps are automated.
* Cheaper QoS deployment because less staff time is involved in analyzing network traffic and determining QoS configuration.
* Faster QoS deployment because there are dramatically fewer commands to issue.
* Companies can implement QoS without needing an in-depth knowledge of QoS concepts


.Task: Display the interface AutoQoS configuration
----
> sh auto qos
----

=== AutoQoS for VOIP

- for voice and video applications
- enables on individual interfaces, but creates both interface and global configuration
- uses CDP on access ports to detect presence or absence of softphone
- trusts COS or DSCP values on trunk or uplink ports


===== AutoQoS on switches

-  no need to enable QoS globally.
* After it is enabled for any interface, the command starts a macro that:

- Globally enables QoS.
- Creates COS-to-DCSP mappings and DSCP-to-COS mappings.
* As the traffic enters the switch, the frame header containing the COS value is removed.
* The switch uses the COS value in the frame header to assign a DSCP value to the packet.
* If the packet exits a trunk port, the internal DSCP value is mapped back to a COS value.
- Enables priority or expedite ingress and egress queues.
- Creates mappings of COS values to ingress and egress queues and thresholds.
- Creates mappings of DSCP values to ingress and egress queues and thresholds.
- Creates class maps and policy maps to identify, prioritize, and police voice traffic.
- Applies those policy maps to the interface.

TIP: For best results, enable AutoQoS before configuring any other QoS on the
switch. You can then go back and modify the default configuration if needed to
fit your specific requirements.


.Task: Enable AutoQoS on an access port
----
(config-if)# auto qos voip {cisco- phone | cisco-softphone}
----

.Task: Enable AutoQoS on uplink port
----
(config-if)# auto qos voip trust
----

===== AutoQoS on routers

.Task: Enable AutoQoS on router port
----
(config-if)# auto qos voip [trust]
----
[NOTE]
====
- Make sure that the interface bandwidth is configured before giving this
command.

* If you change it later, the QoS configuration will not change.  When you issue the *auto qos voip* command on an individual data circuit, the
configuration it creates differs depending on the bandwidth of the circuit
itself.

* Compression and fragmentation are enabled on links of 768 kbps
bandwidth and lower. They are not enabled on links faster than 768 kbps.

* The router additionally configures traffic shaping and applies an AutoQoS service
policy regardless of the bandwidth.


- When you issue the command on a serial interface with a bandwidth of 768 kbps
or less, the router changes the interface encapsulation to PPP. It creates a
PPP Multilink interface and enables Link Fragmentation and Interleave (LFI) on
the interface. Serial interfaces with a configured bandwidth greater than 768
kbps keep their configured encapsulation, and the router merely applies an
AutoQoS service policy to the interface.

- If you use the *trust* keyword in the command, the router creates class maps that
group traffic based on its DSCP values. It associates those class maps with a
created policy map and assigns it to the interface. You would use this keyword
when QoS markings are assigned by a trusted device.

- If you do not use the *trust* keyword, the router creates access lists that match
voice and video data and call control ports. It associates those access lists
with class maps with a created policy map that marks the traffic appropriately.
Any traffic not matching those access lists is marked with DSCP 0. You would
use this command if the traffic either arrives at the router unmarked or
arrives marked by an untrusted device.

=== AutoQoS for Enterprise

- supported on Cisco routers.
- The main difference between it and AutoQoS VoIP is that it automates the QoS configuration for VoIP
plus other network applications, and is meant to be used for WAN links.
-  can be used for Frame Relay and ATM subinterfaces only if they are point-to-point links.
- detects the types and amounts of network traffic with NBAR and then creates
policies based on that.

.Task: Enable Traffic Discovery
----
(config-if)# auto discovery qos [trust]
----
[NOTE]
====
- Make sure that CEF is enabled, that the interface
bandwidth is configured, and that no QoS configuration is on the interface
before giving the command.

- Use the *trust* keyword if the traffic arrives at the
router already marked, and if you trust those markings, because the AutoQoS
policies will use those markings during the configuration stage.
