== Quality Issues

The leading causes of quality issues:

- lack of bandwidth
- latency and jitter
- packet loss


=== Latency

- one-way end-to-end delay (or network latency): time for packets to travel from source to destination
- < 400 ms (ITU recommendations G.114) for general traffic
- < 150 - 200ms for real-time traffic
- consists of: 

** propagation delay (fixed)
** serialization delay (fixed)
** processing delay (fixed)
** delay variation (variable)

==== propagation delay

- time for a packet from source to destination at the speed of light 
* c = 300 000 km/s in a vacuum
* c/n with n=refractive index ~ 1.5 for fibre

.Why 200 ms
....
If a single fiber-optic cable around the equator  (40 000 km)
distance = 40 000 km
n = 1.5 
c = 300 000 km/s 
v = c/n = 200 000 km/s
delay = d/v = 40 000 /200 000 = 200 ms 
....


==== Serialization delay

- fixed time to place all the bits of a packet onto a link
- sd = packet size / line speed
* example: 1500-byte packet over 1 Gbps
* s = 1500 * 8 / 10E9 = 0.012 ms

==== Processing delay

- fixed time to take the packet from an input interface to the output queue of the output interface
- depends on 

  ** CPU speed for software-based platforms
  ** CPU utilization or load
  ** IP packet switching mode (process/fast/CEF)
  ** router architecture (centralized or distributed)
  ** configured features on both input and output interfaces

==== Delay variation or jitter

- difference in the latency between packets in a single flow
- use LLQ to prevent jitter for high-priority real-time traffic


=== Packet loss

- usually a result of congestion on an interface
- can be prevented by
  ** increasing link speed
  ** implementing QoS congestion-avoidance and congestion-management mechanism
  ** implementing traffic policing to drop low-priority packets
  ** implementing traffic shaping to delay packets instead of dropping themce


== QoS models

- Best effort: no QoS
- IntServ (Integrated Services) with RSVP signalling protocol
- DiffServ (Differentiated Services) without RSVP and PHB
