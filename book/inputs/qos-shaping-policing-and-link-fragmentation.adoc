= Shaping, Policing and Link Fragmentation

- Policers: drop or re-mark incoming and outgoing traffic that goes beyond a desired traffic rate
- Shapers: buffer and delay egress traffic rates that momentarily peak above the desired rate
  until the egress traffic rate drops below the defined rate. 
  If the egress traffic rate is below the desired rate, the traffic is sent immediately.

- placement
* policers for incoming at the edge
* policers for outgoing at the edge or core-facing interfaces
* shapers for egress on service provider-facing interfaces

== Token Bucket Algorithms

- CIR: committed information rate
  * traffic in bps defined in the traffic contract
- Tc: committed time interval
  * time interval im ms over which the committed burst (Bc) is sent.
- Bc: committed burst size
  * max size in bytes of the CIR token bucket, 
  * or max amount of traffic that be sent within a Tc.

  Bc= CIR x Tc
