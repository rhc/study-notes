= RESTCONF

- RFC 8040
- Programmatically interface with data defined in YANG models while using NETCONF datastores
- RESTful APi (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS)


|===
| RESTCONF  | NETCONF

| GET  | <get>, <get-config>
| POST  | <edit-config> (operation="create")
| PUT  | <edit-config> (operation="create/replace")
| PATCH  | <edit-config> (operation="merge")
| DELETE  | <edit-config> (operation="delete")
|===


- media types for RESTCONF
  * application/yang.api+xml
  * application/yang.api+json

- RESTCONF API format: https://<address>/<root>/data/<[yang_module:]container>/<leaf>[?<options>]
  * address: IP or hostname and port number where the agent is available
  * root: main entry for RESTCONF requests. Found programmatically using the resource */.well-known/host-meta*
  * [yang_module:]container : base mode container
  * leaf: individual element from within the container
  * [?<options>] : optional for example
    ** depth=unbounded
    ** content=[all, config, nonconfig]
    ** fields=expr

== Telemetry subscriptions

dynamic vs configured::

- Dynamic:
  * The subscriber sends a request, usually via *ietf-yangpush.yang* data model.
  * The device approves the request, replies with a subscription ID and begins streaming telemetry data.
  * cannot be changed but can be terminated at any time, usually by closing the NETCONF
- Configured:
  * configured via CLI, NETCONF, or RESTCONF
  * persisted between reboots
  * can be modified and terminated at any time
  * can be used to stream data to more than one receiver


periodic vs on-change notifications::

- Periodic:
  * sent with fixed rate
  * ideal for device counters or measures (CPU utilization, interface stats)

- On-change:
  * sent only when the data change
  * ideal for faults, new neighbors, thresholds.
