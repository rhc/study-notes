TODO clean this section

Remote Monitoring, or RMON, is an event-notification extension of the SNMP
capabil- ity on a Cisco router or switch. RMON enables you to configure
thresholds for alerting based on SNMP objects, so that you can monitor device
performance and take appropri- ate action to any deviations from the normal
range of performance indications.  RMON is divided into two classes: alarms and
events. An event is a numbered, user- configured threshold for a particular
SNMP object. You configure events to track, for example, CPU utilization or
errors on a particular interface, or anything else you can
do with an SNMP object.

You set the rising and falling thresholds for these events, and then tell RMON
which RMON alarm to trigger when those rising or falling thresholds are
crossed. For example, you might want to have the router watch CPU utilization
and trigger an SNMP trap or log an event when the CPU utilization rises faster
than, say, 20 percent per minute. Or you might configure it to trigger an alarm
when the CPU utiliza- tion rises to some absolute level, such as 80 percent.
Both types of thresholds (relative, or
delta,‚Äù and absolute) are supported. Then, you can configure a different alarm
notifica- tion as the CPU utilization falls, again at some delta or to an
absolute level you specify.


The alarm that corresponds to each event is also configurable in terms of what
it does (logs the event or sends a trap). If you configure an RMON alarm to
send a trap, you also need to supply the SNMP community string for the SNMP
server.



Event and alarm numbering are locally significant. Alarm numbering provides a
pointer to the corresponding event. That is, the configured events each point
to specific alarm num- bers, which you must also define.
