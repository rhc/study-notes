= RTP/RTCP


Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)
- sister protocol of RTP
- provides out-of-band control information for an RTP flow
  * It is used periodically to transmit control packets to
participants in a streaming multimedia session.

- gathers statistics on a media connection and information such as bytes
sent, packets sent, lost packets, jitter, feedback and round trip delay. An
application may use this information to increase the quality of service,
perhaps by limiting flow or using a different codec.



- type of RTCP packets: Sender report packet, Receiver report
packet, Source Description RTCP Packet, Goodbye RTCP Packet and Application
Specific RTCP packets.

- RTCP itself does not provide any flow encryption or authentication means. SRTCP
protocol can be used for that purpose.
