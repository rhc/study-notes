= SD-Access

- fabric: virtualized network
- SD-Access = Campus Fabric + Cisco DNA center

- physical layer:
  * cisco switches:
  * cisco routers
  * cisco wireless: WLCs and APs
  * cisco controller appliances: cisco DNA Center, Cisco ISE

- network layer:
  * underlay network:
    ** avoid layer 2 using STP, =>
       prefers layer 3 routed access using IS-IS as the IGP
       because IS-IS neighbor establishment without IP dependencies,
       peering capabilities using loopback addresses,
       agnostic treatment of IPv4, IPv6, and non-IP traffic
    ** 2 models:
      *** manual underlay:
      *** automated underlay: managed by Cisco DNA Center LAN automation.

  * overlay network (SD-Access Fabric)
    ** fully automated (vs manual  configuration of campus fabric solution with CLI/APi NETCONF/YANG)
    ** control plane: LISP
    ** data plane: vxlan-GPO with support for  64000 Cisco TrustSec SGTs (scalable group tag)
    ** policy plane: assigns Cisco TrustSec SGTs to users or end devices.
      *** support for both network-based segmentation using VNs (VRF instances) and group-based segmentation (policies)
      *** network address-independent group-basd policies based on SGT rather than MAC, IPv4, IPv6
      *** dynamic enforcement on wired and wireless traffic
      *** policy constructs over a legacy or third-party network using vxlan
      *** extended policy enforcement to external networks (cloud, DCs) by transporting the tags to Cisco TrustSec-aware devices using SXP (SGT Exchange Protocol)

    ** components (5)
      1. control plane node: contains settings, protocols, mapping tables to provide EID-to-RLOC mapping for the fabric overlay
      2. fabric border node:  connects external L3 networks to the SDA fabric (e.g. core layer device)
      3. fabric edge node: connects wired endpoints to the SDA fabric (e.g. access, distribution layer device)
      4. fabric WLC: connects APs and wireless endpoints to the SDA fabric
      5. intermediate nodes: routers or extended switches in the underlay

== Control Plane - LISP

== Data Plane - VXLAN-GPO

== Policy Plane - Cisco TrustSec

- Traffic is segmented  based on a scalable group, and not based on topology (VLAN or IP subnet)
- SGTs are assigned to enforce access policies for users, applications, devices

- The traditional approach to security in enterprise network creates several
  limitations and complexities. Security policies that are based on IP
  addresses within subnets and VLANs tend to be complex and difficult to
  manage. The enforcement and management of these policies throughout the
  network can be an administrative task that requires much skill as access
  lists tend to grow with the organization. Another drawback of this current
  approach is the static nature of access lists. As network become more
  dynamic, constant changes with network policy become difficult.

- The ultimate goal of Cisco TrustSec technology is to assign a tag (known as a
  Scalable Group Tag, or SGT) to the user’s or device’s traffic at the ingress
  (inbound into the network), and then enforce the access policy based on the
  tag elsewhere in the infrastructure (for example, data center). Switches,
  routers, and firewalls use the SGT to make forwarding decisions. For
  instance, an SGT may be assigned to a Guest user, so that the Guest traffic
  may be isolated from non-Guest traffic throughout the infrastructure.

- The Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) acts as a controller for
  software-defined segmentation groups and policies, providing a layer of
  policy abstraction and centralized administration. Cisco ISE allows
  segmentation policies to be applied to networks of any size using a simple
  and clear policy matrix.

In Cisco SD-access fabric, Cisco ISE defines and manages SGTs on your network
by enforcing the policies on the edge nodes. An SGT is a 16-bit value that
Cisco ISE assigns to the user or endpoint’s session upon login. The network
infrastructure views the SGT as another attribute to assign to the session and
inserts the Layer 2 tag to all traffic from that session. The SGT value is
inserted as part of the Cisco Meta Data header field that is added by the
infrastructure to frames sourcing from the endpoint. The endpoint itself is not
aware of the tag. It is known in the network infrastructure. Within the network
infrastructure, only the trusted or authenticated peers can apply the tag.

An SGT can be assigned dynamically or statically. Dynamic classification occurs
via an authentication sequence, via 802.1x, MAB, or web authentication. When
the authentication is not available, static classification methods are
necessary. In static classification, you can map the tag to an IP address,
subnet, VLAN, or interface rather than relying on an authorization from Cisco
ISE.

The Cisco TrustSec Network Device Admission Control (NDAC) feature creates an
independent layer of trust between Cisco TrustSec devices to prohibit rogue
devices from being allowed on the network.
