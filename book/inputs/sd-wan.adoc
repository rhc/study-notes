= SD-WAN

- The Cisco SD-WAN solution is a software-based, virtual IP fabric overlay
  network that builds a secure, unified connectivity over any transport network
  (the underlay). The underlay transport network is the physical infrastructure
  for the WAN, such as public internet, MPLS, Metro Ethernet, and LTE/4G. The
  underlay network provides a service to the overlay network and is responsible
  for the delivery of packets across networks.

- SD-WAN represents the shift from an older, hardware-based model of legacy WAN
  to a secure, software-based, virtual IP fabric overlay that runs over
  standard network transport services.

== SD-WAN components

image::sd-wan-components.png[]

- vEdge (physical ) routers or vEdge (VM) cloud router
- vSmart controllers:
- vBond orchestrator: authenticates all SD-WAN devices when they join the SD-WAN overlay network
- vManage NMS:


=== vBond - Orchestrator plane

- responsible for Zero touch deployment and security validation during deployment
  * first point of authentication
  * orchestrates connectivity between management, control and data plane
  * requires public IP or 1:1 NAT
  * facilitates NAT transversal
  * all other components need to know the vBond IP address or DNS information
  * authorizes all control connections (zero-trust certificate-based white-list model)
  * distributes list of vSmart controllers to all vEdge Routers
  * can run in single or multi-tenant mode

=== vManage - Management Plane

image::sd-wan-vManage.png[]

- single pane of glass for day0, day1, day2 operations
  * Web GUI with RBAC (Role based access control)
- real time alerting
- centralized provisioning
- configuration standardization
- simplicity of deploying
- simplicity of change
- supports various APIs

=== vSmart - Control Plane

- centralized brain of the solution
- establishes OMP (overly management protocol) peering with all vEdge routers
- implements service chaining, traffic engineering, per-VPN topology
- acts as distribution point to establish the data plane connectivity between vEdge routes
  * service LAN-side reachability
  * transport WAN-side IP addressing
  * IPsec encryption keys
  * site identifiers
- acts as a router reflector between vEdge routers and other vSmart
  * solves the n^2^ complexity
- HA deployment in geographically dispersed DCs in Cisco Cloud or on-premisses


=== vEdge - Data Plane

- responsible for tunnel establishment and data forwarding within the fabric
- physical and VM form factors (100Mb, 1Gb, 10Gb)
  * public clouds (AWS, Azure)
  * network function virtualization on the virtual customer premise equipment/universal customer premise equipment (vCPE/uCPE)
    platforms with KVM (kernel-based VM) or ESXi (Elastic Sky X Integrated) hypervisors
- supports ZTD (zero touch deployment)
- uses traditional routing protocols (ospf, bgp, vrrp) for integration with non-fabric networks



=== vAnalytics - Automation and Analytics

- graphical representations of the performance of the entire SD-WAN overlay network
- display information for the last 24 hours by default
- calculates vQoE (Quality of Experience) = function( latency, loss, jitter, application )

image::sd-wan-vAnalytics.png[]

- provides real-time information for failure correlation, cross-customer benchmarking, application performances scores
- enables future planning based on intelligent data ( application and bandwidth forecasting, branch expansion analysis, policy change what-if's )
- provides QoE score for apps

-

== Service Management



TODO insert slide here

== Tenancy options

- supported in all deployment models

=== single tenancy

=== vpn tenancy

- vpn as a tenant
- all control elements are shared accross customers
- must have service orchestrator for per-tenant operations on top on vManage

=== enterprice tenancy

- vBond and vManage are shared accross customer
- vSmart is dedicated to specific customer deployment
- VPNs can be used to segregate application traffic


== Security deep dive

TODO
- signature on vEdge

* TPM (Tamper Proof Module) hardware chip generates public/private key
* Avnet signing authority
* Symantec

- signature on vManage, vBond, vSmart
