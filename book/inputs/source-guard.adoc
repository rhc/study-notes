= IP Source Guard

TODO Improve


IP Source Guard will inspect traffic from hosts to be certain they're not
spoofing their IP address or, optionally, MAC address.  As mentioned, it knows
the MAC and IP information from the DHCP snooping database.  Enabling the
feature is simple:

----
SW1(config-if)#ip verify source ! check IP addresses
SW1(config-if)#ip verify source port-security ! check IPs & MACs
----

If you don't want to rely strictly on the DHCP snooping database, you can make
manual entries:

----
SW1(config)#ip source binding mac-address vlan vlan ip-address interface interface
----

Of important note, source guard can be used in a non-DHCP environment using the
above command to populate the reference table, however, you must still enable
dhcp snooping globally and on the specific VLAN in order for source guard to
function!

[WARNING]
GNS3 doesn't support this feature
