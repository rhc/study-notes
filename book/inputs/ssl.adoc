= SSL/TLS


- secure socket layer
- ISO L6 layer where the socket is opened
- created by netscape in 1994 to secure web transactions
- SSLv3 RFC 6101
- replaced by TLS (transport layer security) (read RFC 7568 for build-in design flaws)
* TCP/IP transport layer, where the socket is opened
* TLS v1.0: rfc 2246
* TLS v1.2: rfc 5246
* TLS v1.3: draft


== Use cases

- Protocol, port
- HTTPS, 443
- SMTPS, 465
- imaps, 993
- pop3s, 995
- ftps, 990
- ldaps, 636


- ssl/tls can be used to secure vpn tunnel instead of IPsec

- ssl/tls session works in 2 phases
  * negotiate ssl/tls tunnel (control-plane)
  * transmit data over the ssl/tls tunnel (data-plane)

- both phases make use of the ssl/tls record protocol

== tunnel negotiation

- uses tcp port 443 for negotiation
* negotiate ssl/tls version
* authenticate each other
* negotiate key exchange algorithms
* negotiate cypher suite algorithms

=== authentication 


- server uses digital certificate with (RSA, DSA, ECDSA) algorithm
- client uses simple or multiple auth:
  * only digital certificate or username/password
  * digital certificate + username/password
  * digital certificate + 2 sets of username/password


=== key management/exchange algorithm

- derives the keying material which is used to secure/protect 
  * last messages of tunnel negotiation
  * data-plane traffic
- RSA, DH/DHE, ECDH/ECDHE


=== Cypher suite algorithm

- protects the data-plane traffic 
- negotiates integrity/hashing: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2
- negotiates encryption: RCA, IDEA, DES, DES3, AES

== data-plane

- can uses TLS over tcp 
- can uses DTLS over udp (for real-time sensitive traffic) 
  * dtls only supported by tls
  * dtls v1.2 in RFC 6347



== SSL VPN

- Why it was invented? what purpose ?
- most vendors support only remote-access ssl vpn and not site-to-site vpns
- 2 variations:
  * client-based: (cisco AnyConnect)
  * clientless: (browser based)


=== client-based ssl vpn

- requires vpn client software to be installed
- needs client profiles
  * old config in  *.pcf file
  * current in xml format
- benefits:
  * supports  all IP apps
  * supports real-time applications and DTLS
- allocates an IP address to the AnyConnect client NIC card
  * on the protect network, traffic seems to be sourced from AnyConnect IP address
  * remote client sends traffic through the ssl tunnel,
  * ASA decrypts the traffic and routes it further on the protected network 


TODO configure ASA 

- provision the certificate
- enable client-based ssl vpn 
- configure remote-access client ip addressing
- configure split-tuneling policy
- configure connection-profile/tunnel-group
- configure group policy
- configure RRI (reverse route injection)
