= Telnet

- allows a user at one site to establish a TCP connection to a login
server at another site, then passes the keystrokes from one system to the
other.

- offers 3 main services:

**  Network virtual terminal connection
**  Option negotiation
**  Symmetric connection

- Cisco implementation of Telnet supports the following Telnet options:

**  Remote echo
**  Binary transmission
**  Suppress go ahead
**  Timing mark
**  Terminal type
**  Send location
**  Terminal speed
**  Remote flow control
**  X display location


.Task: Specify the IP address of an interface as the source address for Telnet connections
----
(config)# ip telnet source-interface <interface>
----
[NOTE]
====
- If the specified interface is not up, IOS selects
  the address of the interface closest to the destination as the source address.
====

.Task: Set the TCP window to zero when the Telnet connection is idle
----
(config)# service telnet-zeroidle
----
[NOTE]
====
- Normally, data sent to noncurrent Telnet connections is accepted and discarded.
  When *service telnet-zero-idle* is enabled, if a session is
  suspended (that is, some other connection is made active or the EXEC is
  sitting in command mode), the TCP window is set to zero. This action prevents
  the remote host from sending any more data until the connection is resumed.
- Use this command when it is important that all messages sent by the host be
  seen by the users and the users are likely to use multiple sessions.
- Do not use this command if your host will eventually time out and log out a
  TCP user whose window is zero.
