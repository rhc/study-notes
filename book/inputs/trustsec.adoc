= Cisco TrustSec

- Short answer: Initially defined as as architecture comprising of several components but most of the time, people thing of Security Group Tags (SGTs) when they think of Trustsec
  * ingress tagging
  * egress enforcement with a matrix

- Long Answer: Several components including -
  * Centralized policy management, distributed policy enforcement and microsegmentation using Security Group Tags (SGTs)
  * Confidentiality and integrity using encryption based on IEEE 802.1AE (AES-GCM 128-bit)
    ** Wire-rate hop-by-hop layer 2 encryption
    ** Key management is based on 802.1n

  * Authenticated networking environment
    ** Endpoints are authenticated via 802.1x, Easyconnect, MAB, WebAuth, etc
    ** Network devices are authenticated and admitted into the Trustsec environment via 802.1x which creates a trusted networking environment

== Terminology:

Security Group:: Used for grouping users, endpoints, and resources that should have a similar access control policy

Security Group Tag (SGT) :: - Unique security group number that’s assigned to the security group

Trustsec-Capable Device:: - Network access device that’s capable hardware- and software-wise of understanding security group tags

Trustsec Seed Device:: - Network access device that authenticates directly against ISE and acts as both the authenticator and supplicant for other network access devices

Network Device Admission Control (NDAC):: - In a Trustsec cloud, network devices are verified with credentials by the peer device:

** 802.1x
** EAP-FAST
** Upon authentication and authorization, network devices negotiate for IEEE 802.1AE encryption

Protected Access Credential (PAC):: - Unique shared credential used to mutually authenticate client and server

Endpoint Authentication Control:: - Devices authenticated to the Trustsec cloud via 802.1x, Easyconnect, MAB, Webauth, etc

Security Group Access Control List (SGACL):: - Used for access and permissions based on SGTs, not IP addresses or subnets. Simplifies the security policy.

Security Exchange Protocol (SXP):: - A service that’s used to propagate IP-to-SGT bindings across network devices that don’t support SGTs. Think of it like BGP propagating routes across a provider’s MPLS.

Environment Data Download:: - Download from ISE to the Network Access Device when it joins the trusted network. When it does this, it downloads the following:

** ISE RADIUS server list it can use for future RADIUS authentications and authorizations
** Device SGT - SGT for the network access device itself
** Expiry Timeout - How often the network access device should download or refresh the environment data

Identity to port mapping:: - Switch defining the identity on a port and using this identity to look up a particular SGT value from ISE


== Operations

- classification: assignment of an SGT to an IP address
  * statically in DC
    ** based on (ip address, vlan, port)
    ** can be configured on Cisco ISE and downloaded to NAD
  * dynamically at the access layer
    ** using IEEE 802.1x, MAB, WebAuth
    ** based on (user, device type, posture status, location, time)
- transport:
  * inline tagging: embedded in the Ethernet frame
  * SXP (SGT eXchange Protocol): for devices that do not support inline tagging
- enforcement:
  * based on source and destination SGTs
  * accomplished with SGACLs on switches and SGFW on routers and firewalls


== Frame Format

TODO

- Ethertype: 0x8909
- overhead: 40 bytes = (MACsec 802.1AE + Trustsec overhead) + 20 bytes (MACsec)
