- Problem:  unidirectional links
  * one of the 2 transmission paths has failed but not both
  * due to miscabling, cutting on fiber cable, unplugging one fiber, GBIC problems, ...
  * can cause a loop as the previously blocking port will move to a forwarding state

UDLD **U**ni**D**irectional **L**ink **D**etection:::
- Uses Layer 2 messaging to decide when a switch can no longer receive frames from
a neighbor. The switch whose transmit interface did not fail is placed into an err-disabled state.
- Cisco Proprietary
- Multicast Address 01:00:0C:CC:CC:CC


== Operations

- Each UDLD port  sends protocol messages that contains the own device/port ID and the neighbor's IDs seen by UDLD.
- If the port doesn't see its own device/port ID in the incoming UDLD packet for a specific amount of time,
  the link is considered unidirectional.
- It is recommended to keep stem:[T_(\d\e\t\ection)<T_(reconver\g\ence)]
  by choosing an appropriate message interval
  which ensures that UDLD is detected before STP forward delay expires

=== Normal Mode

- default
- marks as *Undertermined* if port at Layer 1 is still up
- does NOT shutdown or disable the port
- does NOt prevent physical loops (informational and less disrupptive)


=== Aggresive Mode

- Attempts to reconnect with the other switch (eight times)
after realizing no messages have been received.
- If the other switch does not reply to the repeated additional messages,
both sides become err-disabled.
- no automatic recovery unless UDLD err-disable recovery is configured

== Default Configuration

:===
Feature                                                    : Default Setting

UDLD global enable state                                   : Globally disabled
UDLD per-port enable state for fiber-optic media           : Disabled on all Ethernet fiber-optic ports
UDLD per-port enable state for UTP copper media            : Disabled on all Ethernet 10/100/1000BASE-TX ports
UDLD aggressive mode                                       : Disabled
:===

.Task: Enable UDLD Globally
----
(config)# udld {aggressive | enable | message time <seconds>}
----

.Task: Configure the period of time between UDLD probe messages
----
(config)# udld message time <seconds>}
----
[NOTE]
====
- configure the period of time between UDLD probe messages on ports
that are in the advertisement phase and are detected to be bidirectional.
- range: 1 to 90 seconds
- default: 15 seconds

- This command affects fiber-optic ports only. Use *(config-if)# udld*
to enable UDLD on other port types.
====

.Task: Enable UDLD on an Interface
----
(config-if)# udld
----

.Task: Reset an Interface Disabled by UDLD
----
# udld reset
----

You can also  restart the disabled port

- *shutdown* followed by *no shutdown*
- *no udld {aggressive | enable}* followed by *udld {aggressive | enable}*
- *no udld port* followed by *udld port [aggressive]*

== UDLD Error-Disabled State

.Task: Recover from the UDLD Error-Disabled State
----
! Enable UDLD to automatically recover
(config)# errdisable recovery cause udld

! Specify the time to recover from the UDLD error-disabled state
(config-if)# errdisable recovery interval <seconds>
----

.Task: Display UDLD Status
----
# show udld [interface-id]
----


== UDLD vs Loop Guard

- complementary and can be both configured at the same time

  In certain designs there are unidirectional links that Loop Guard can prevent
  and UDLD cannot, and likewise ones that UDLD can prevent but Loop Guard cannot.
  For example, if a loop occurs because of a physical wiring problem (for
  example, someone mistakenly mixes up the send and receive pairs of a fiber
  link), UDLD can detect this, but Loop Guard cannot. Likewise, if there is a
  unidirectional link caused by a failure in the STP software itself, although
  much more rare, Loop Guard can detect this but UDLD cannot.
