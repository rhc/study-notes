Access Control is responsible for authenticating and authorizing devices
connecting at the edge of the network. Access Control allows customers to
assign devices to a specific network "segment," which usually corresponds to
deploying a device in a dedicated VLAN.

Services Edge is responsible for centralizing policy enforcement points where
it is possible to control and restrict communications between separate logical
partitions or access to services that can be dedicated or shared between
virtual networks.

Path isolation is an overlay network and refers to the creation of independent
logical traffic paths to isolate traffic between users belonging to separate
groups (example guest and partners) over a shared physical network
infrastructure.
