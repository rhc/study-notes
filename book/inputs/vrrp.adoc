- https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3768.txt[RFC 3768]
- Similar to HSRP
- Multicast virtual MAC address (0000.5E00.01__xx__, where __xx__ is the hex VRRP group number).
- Uses the IOS object tracking feature, rather than its own internal tracking mechanism, to track interface states for failover purposes.
- Preemption by default
- The group IP address is the interface IP address of one of the VRRP routers.
- multicasts advertisements to 224.0.0.18 with protocol number 112
- default advertisement interval: 1s
- default hold time: 3s


VRRP is similar to HSRP, both in operation and configuration. The VRRP master
is analogous to the HSRP active gateway, while the VRRP backup is analogous to
the HSRP standby gateway. A VRRP group has one master device and one or
multiple backup devices. A device with the highest priority is the elected
master. The priority can be a number between 0 and 255. The priority value 0
has a special meaningâ€”it indicates that the current master has stopped
participating in VRRP. This setting is used to trigger backup devices to
quickly transition to master without having to wait for the current master to
time out.

VRRP differs from HSRP in that it allows you to use an address of one of the
physical VRRP group members as a virtual IP address. In this case, the device
with the used physical address is a VRRP master whenever it is available.

The master is the only device that sends advertisements (analogous to HSRP
hellos). Advertisements are sent to the 224.0.0.18 multicast address, with the
protocol number 112. The default advertisement interval is 1 second. The
default holdtime is 3 seconds. HSRP, in comparison, has the default hello timer
set to 3 seconds and the hold timer to 10 seconds.

Although the VRRP protocol as per RFC 3768 does not support millisecond timers,
Cisco devices allow you to configure millisecond timers. You need to manually
configure the millisecond timer values on both the master and the backup
devices. Use the millisecond timers only when absolutely necessary and with
careful consideration and testing. Millisecond values work only under favorable
circumstances, and you must be aware that the use of the millisecond timer
values restricts VRRP operation to Cisco devices only.

- cisco supports vrrp authentification even if authentication support was removed in last RFCs
- VRRP used plaintext and MD5 authentication with RFC 2338.
- RFC 3768 and RFC 5798 remove authentication support for VRRP.
- Cisco IOS Software still supports the RFC 2338 authentication mechanisms.
