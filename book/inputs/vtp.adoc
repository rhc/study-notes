- Vlan Trunk Protocol
- Cisco-proprietary that distributes VLAN information among Catalyst switches
- Advertises the VLAN ID, Name and Type but not which ports should be in each VLAN
- Eases administrative burden for addition, deletion and renaming of VLANs
- Supports 1005 VLANs (IP base or IP services feature set) or 255 VLANs (LAN base feature set)

== VTP Version

=== V1

- Default: version 1
- supports normal range only


=== V2

- supports for Token Ring Concentrator Relay Function and Bridge Relay Function
- propagates unknown TLV records
- Optimized VLAN database consistency checking:
* In VTPv1, VLAN database consistency checks are performed whenever the VLAN database is modified, either through CLI, SNMP, or VTP.
* In VTPv2, these consistency checks are skipped if the change was caused by a received VTP message, as the message itself was originated as a result of a CLI or SNMP action that must already have been sanitized.
* This is really just an implementation optimization.

=== V3

- Supports the whole IEEE 802.1q vlan range up to 4095 ( v1 and v2 support only normal range VLANs 1-1005)
- Can send private LAN information in addition to normal VLAN information.
- Backward compatible with VTP 2
- Add support for databases other than VLAN databases such as MST databases.
- Clear text or hidden password protection
* The encrypted VTP password cannot be displayed back as plaintext.
* While this encrypted string can be carried over to a different switch to make it a valid member of the domain,
  the promotion of a secondary server into the primary server role will require entering the password in its plaintext form.
- Supports the *off* mode in which the switch does not participate in VTPv3 operations and drops all received VTP messages:
- Can deactivate VTP on a per-trunk basis
- VTPv3 is a generalized mechanism for distributing contents of an arbitrary database,
  and is not limited to synchronizing VLAN information over a set of switches:
  * As an example, VTPv3 is also capable of distributing and synchronizing the MST region configuration among all switches in a VTP domain

== VTP Message Format

- Encapsulated in ISL or 802.1q frames
- Multicasted to  MAC address: 0100-0CCC-CCCC, LLC code: SNAP (AAAA), Type 2003 in the SNAP Header
- Carried through trunk ports and VLAN 1

.Example: VTP Packet Encapsulated In ISL Frame
image::vtp-in-isl.png[height=80]

- The VTP header contains these fields:
  * VTP protocol version: 1,2,3
  * VTP message types: summary advertisements, subset advertisements, advertisement requests, VTP join messages
  * management domain length
  * management domain name

=== Summary Advertisements

- Sent by Server and Client every 5 minutes intervals, and in addition, after each modificaton of the VLAN database
- carries information about VTP domain name,
  revision number,
  identity of the last updater,
  time stamp of the last update,
  MD5 sum computed over the contents of the VLAN database and the VTP password (if configured),
  and the number of Subset Advertisement messages that optionally follow this Summary Advertisement.
- summary messages do not carry VLAN database contents.
- When the switch receives a summary advertisement packet,
  * The switch compares the VTP domain name to its own VTP domain name.
  * If the name is different, the switch simply ignores the packet.
  * If the name is the same, the switch then compares the configuration revision to its own revision.
  * If its own configuration revision is higher or equal, the packet is ignored.
  * If it is lower, an advertisement request is sent.

----

[horizontal]
Followers:: Indicates that this packet is followed by a Subset Advertisement packet.
Updater Identity:: IP address of the switch that is the last to have incremented the configuration revision.
Update Timestamp:: Date and time of the last increment of the configuration revision.
MD5 Digest:: If MD5 is configured and used to authenticate the validation of a VTP update.

=== Subset Advertisements

- Follows the summary advertisement after addition, deletion or modification of a VLAN.
- Contains a list of VLAN information.

  * VLAN-info field 1 [len = 32]
  * ................. [len = 32]
  * VLAN-info field n [len = 32]
}
----

Sequence number::
- Identify the packet in the stream of packets that follow a summary advertisement
- Starts with value 1

=== Advertisement Request

A switch needs a VTP advertisement request in these situations:

- The switch has been reset.
- The VTP domain name has been changed.
- The switch has received a VTP summary advertisement with a higher configuration revision than its own.

Upon receipt of an advertisement request, a VTP device sends a summary advertisement.
One or more subset advertisements follow the summary advertisement. This is an example:

.VTP Advertisement Request
["packetdiag", target="vtp-request-advert-packet-format.png"]
----
diagram {
  colwidth = 32
  node_height = 32
  default_node_color = lightyellow

  * Version [len = 8]
  * Code = 0x03 [len = 8]
  * Rsvd [len = 8]
  * MgmtD Len [len = 8]
  * Management Domain Name (zero-padded to 32 bytes) [len = 32]
  * Start-Value [len = 32]
}
----

Start-Value::
This is used in cases in which there are several subset advertisements.
If the first (n) subset advertisement has been received
and the subsequent one (n+1) has not been received,
the Catalyst only requests advertisements from the (n+1)th one.

=== Join Message

- originated by each VTP Server and Client switch periodically every 6 seconds if VTP Pruning is active.
- Join messages contain a bit field that, for each VLAN in the normal range, indicates whether it is active or unused (that is, pruned)


IMPORTANT: In any VTP version, VTP messages are transmitted and accepted only on trunk ports.
Access ports neither send nor accept VTP messages.
For two switches to communicate in VTP, they must first be interconnected through a working trunk link.

== VTP Domain

- Controls which devices can exchange VTP advertisements
- Defaults to NULL value
- Switch inherits VTP domain name of first received advertisement over trunk links
- A switch can only be part of one domain at a time

.Task: Set the VTP Domain Name
----
(config)# vtp domain <name>
----

== Configuration Revision Number

- 32-bit
- Incremented by one for each configuration change
- Higher revision indicates newer database


[IMPORTANT]
====
For a newly connected VTP server or client to change another switch’s VTP database, the following must be true:

- The new link connecting the new switch is trunking.
- The new switch has the same VTP domain name as the other switches.
- The new switch’s revision number is higher than that of the existing switches.
- The new switch must have the same password, if configured on the existing switches.
====

== VTP Modes

You can configure a switch to operate in any one of these VTP modes:

Server::
- Default mode
- Allows addition, deletion and modification of VLAN information
- Changes on server overwrite the rest of the domain
- Configuration saved in NVRAM

.Task: Configure the Switch As a VTP Server
----
(config)# vtp mode server
----

Client::
- Cannot add, remove or modify VLAN information
- Listens for advertisements originated by server, install them and passes them on
- Configuration saved in NVRAM only for VTPv3

.Task: Configure the Switch As a VTP Client
----
(config)# vtp mode client
----

Transparent::
- Keeps a separate VTP database from the rest of the domain
- Does not originate advertisements
- "transparently" passes received advertisements through without installing them
- Can still create, remove or renamed VLANs which are not advertised to neighboring switches.
- Need for some applications like Private VLANs

.Task: Setup VTP Transparent Mode
----
(config)# vtp mode transparent
----

Off (configurable only in CatOS switches)::
- Like VTP transparent mode with the exception that VTP advertisements are not forwarded

|===

== VTP Security

- MD5 authentication prevents against certain attack
  * Does not prevent against misconfiguration
  * Password must be setup manually because switches only exchanges MD5 digest of the password.

.Task: Configure VTP Authentication
----
(config)# vtp password <string>
----

.Task: Show the VTP Password
----
(config)# sh vtp password
----

== VTP Pruning

- Problem:
  * Broadcasts and unknown unicast/multicast frame are flooded everywhere in the broadcast domain
  included through trunks links
  * Manual editing allowed list is a huge administrative overhead

image::flooding-traffic-without-vtp-pruning.png[Flooding traffic without VTP pruning]

- Solution: VTP pruning
  * Switches advertise what they need
  - All other VLANs are pruned off the trunk link

image::flooding-traffic-with-vtp-pruning.png[Optimized flooded traffic with VTP pruning]

- Restriction:
  * Pruning does not work in transparent mode. Why?

=== Pruning Eligibility

- When VTP pruning is enabled on a VTP server,
  pruning is enabled for the entire management domain
  except for pruning-ineligible VLANS ( Vlan 1, 1002-1005, 1006-4094)

- Making VLANs pruning-eligible or pruning-ineligible affects pruning eligibility for those VLANs on that trunk only
  (not on all switches in the VTP domain).

- VTP pruning takes effect several seconds after you enable it.
