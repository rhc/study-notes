- Virtual eXtensible LAN
- MAC-in-IP/UDP encapsulation
- VNI (VXLAN Network Identifier)  24-bit = 16 million) vs VLAN ID 12-bit (4096)
  * outer header that encapsulates the inner MAC frame originates by a VM
- extends LAN segment over L3 networks using L3 ECMP
- RFC 7348
- Port 4789 (IANA), Port 8472 (default on Linux)
- uses VTEPS (vxlan tunnel endpoints) to originate/terminate VXLAN tunnels
- each VTEP has at least 2 interfaces:
  * a switch interface on the overlay L2 LAN segment,
  * an IP interface in the transport, underlay, L3 network

- L2 overlay over L3 network
- used to flood BUM (broadcast, unknow unicast, multicast) with HER (head-end replication)

== Problem statement

- limitations imposed by STP and VLAN ranges
  * 12-bit vlan id gives only 4094 vlans
  * stp 802.1d blocks redundant links to avoid loops
- multi-tenant environments
  *
- inadequate table sizes at ToR (top of the rack) switch

=== VXLAN-GPO packet format

- VXLAN Group Policy Extension (GPO)
- latest version of VXLAN
- adds special reserved  fields in the header to carry the virtual network IDs and the SGTs. (segment ID - 16 bits)
- The source port is a hash value that is created using the original source information
  and prevents polarization in the underlay.
- destination port  always 4789.


- group policy ID: 16-bit
- Group based policy extension bit (G Bit)
- Don't learn Bit (D Bit)
- Policy applied bit (A Bit)



NOTE: Both Cisco OTV and VXLAN technologies enable you to stretch your Layer 2
network. The primary difference between these two technologies is in usage.
Cisco OTVâ€™s primary use is to provide you with Layer 2 connectivity over Layer
3 network between two data centers. Cisco OTV uses mechanisms, such as ARP
caching and IS-IS routing, to greatly reduce amount of broadcast traffic; VXLAN
is not that conservative because it is intended to use within a single data center.


== VXLAN gateways

The VXLAN is a relatively new technology, so data centers contain devices that
are not capable of supporting VXLAN, such as legacy hypervisors, physical
servers, and network services appliances. Those devices reside on classic VLAN
segments. You would enable VLAN-VXLAN connectivity by using a VXLAN Layer 2
gateway. A VXLAN Layer 2 gateway is a VTEP device that combines a VXLAN segment
and a classic VLAN segment into one common Layer 2 domain.

Similar to traditional routing between different VLANs, a VXLAN Layer 3
gateway, also known as VXLAN router, routes between different VXLAN segments.
The VXLAN router translates frames from one VNI to another. Depending on the
source and destination, this process might require de-encapsulation and
re-encapsulation of a frame. You could also implement routing between native
Layer 3 interfaces and VXLAN segments.
