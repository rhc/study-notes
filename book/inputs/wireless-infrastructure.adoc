== Deployment

- Autonomous:
	* Used for hotspots or smaller enterprises.
	* Individual Access Point (AP) management.
	* Simple to deploy and cost-effective.

- Centralized:
	* Campus environments where traffic is centralized.
	* APs connect to switches, which connect to centralized WLCs.

- FlexConnect:
	* Designed for enterprises that have branch or remote offices.
	* Locations with a relatively small number of APs where deployment of a WLC is not justified or desired.
	* WLAN data traffic is either tunneled back to a central WLC (central switching), or the data traffic is broken out locally at the wired interface (local switching) of the AP.

- SD-Access Wireless:
	* Integration of wireless access in the SD-Access architecture.
	* Moves the enterprise network from current VLAN-centric architecture to a user group-based enterprise architecture, with flexible Layer 2 extensions within and across sites.
	* Automated network provisioning via the DNA Center application.

- Cloud-managed:
	* Cloud-based virtual controllers provided via the Cisco Meraki or the Cisco 9800 Cloud Controller solutions.
	* Centralized installation and management.
	* Scales from small branches to large networks.
	* Reduces operational costs
	* Reduces IT staff size
