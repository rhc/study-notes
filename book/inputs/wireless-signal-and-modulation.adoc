:stem: asciimath

- electro-magnetic waves
- frequency f in Hz = 1 cycle/s
- 3kHz .. 300 kHz radio frequency

2.4 GHz band
5 GHz band
  - 5.150 .. 5.250
  - 5.250 .. 5.350
  - 5.450 .. 5.725
  - 5.725 .. 5.825

- band: multiple channels
* channel number
* channel spacing

- phase
  * shift relative to the start of a cycle
  * measured in degres

- wavelength
  * lambda = c / frequency

- amplitude: from top peak to bottom peak of the signal's waveform

- decibel

stem:[dB = 10 (log_10 P2 - log_10 P1) = 10 log_10 ((P2 )/ (P1))]

  P1 reference value
  P2 source of interest

[NOTE]
====
law of zero: dB=0 => P1 = P2
Law of 3s: dB=3 => P2 = 2 * P1
Law of 10s: dB=10 => P2 = 10 * P1

====

- dBm
  * where P1= 1mW

- dBi

- dBi = dBd (dipole) + 2.14 dBi //TODO

- EIRP
  * effective isotropic radiated power
  * EIRP = Tx(Power) - Tx(Cable) + Tx(Antenna)

- Free space path loss

 * stem:[FSPL(dB) = 20 log_10(d) + 20log_10 (f) +32.44]
 ** d distance in km,
 ** f frequency in MHz

- RSSI
  * Received Signal Strength Indicator
  * 0..255
  * not standard between vendors

- noise floor
  * average signal strength of the noise


- SNR signal-to-noise

== Modulation

- DSSS: direct sequence spread spectrum
  * used in 2.4 GHz band,
  * a small number of fixed, wide channels support complex phase modulation schemes

- OFDM: orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
  * used in 2.4 and 5 GHz bands
  * a single 20 MHz channel contains data that is sent in parallel over multiple frequency
  * each channel is divided into many subcarriers (subchannels, tones)
  * both phase and amplitude are modulated with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)
