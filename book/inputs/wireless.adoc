= Wireless Infrastructure

== Wireless LAN topologies

- autonomous AP

- lightweight AP


capwap (control and provisioning of wireless access points):
- protocol that enables an access controller to manage a collection of wireless termination points
- rfc 5415


== AP operations

=== universal AP Priming

- manual priming
  * with smartphone running Cisco AirProvision app
  * connected to the AP SSID (service set identifier)
  * uses GPS unit and country code.
  * must use WPA-PSK

- automatic priming
  * cisco NDP (Neighbor discovery protocol)

=== capwap discovery

- subnetwork bcast
- locally stored
- dhcp:
  * AP send dhcp discover request with option 43 ipv4, 52 ipv6

- dns: CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.<localdomain>


- ap join order: primary, secondary, tertiary, master, least loaded

=== ap failover

- hello heartbeat: 30s if ack, 5 x 1s if no ack

- ap fallback: to primary controller when primary back


=== HA



=== AP modes

- local mode
- flexConnect mode
  * connected mode
    ** central auth- central switching
    ** central auth- local switching
    ** local auth- local switching
  * standalone mode
    ** auth down - central switching
    ** auth down - local switching
    ** local auth - local switching
- bridge mode:
  * point-to-point
  * point-to-multipoint
  * mesh controller
    * RAP: root AP connected to the wired network
    * MAP: Mesh AP


- oeap mode
  * office extend AP mode
- ap monitor mode
- ap rogue detector mode
- ap sniffer mode
- ap se-connect mode





== Troubleshooting


- Client to AP connectivity:
	* Antennas and RF Interference:
	* AP Power (PoE)
	* Client Association with AP

- WLAN Configuration
	* Network-Side Issues
	* Client-Side Issues

- Infrastructure Configuration:
	* VLAN/Trunk Configuration
	* AP Association with Wireless LAN Controller
	* Time Synchronization
	* RF Groups and Mobility Groups
	* Wireless LAN Controller Security Settings
