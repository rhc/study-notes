= IP multicast introduction


== Definitions

IP multicasting::
Sending a message from a single source to selected multiple destinations across a
Layer 3 network in one data stream.
If you want to send a message from one source to one destination, you could send a unicast


== Multicast IP addressing

Multicast applications always use a multicast IP address. This multicast address represents the
multicast application and is referred to as a multicast group. Unlike a unicast IP address, which
uniquely identifies a single IP host, a multicast address used as a destination address on an IP
packet signifies that the packet is carrying traffic for a specific multicast application. For example,
if a multicast packet is traveling over a network with a destination address 225.5.5.5, it is
proclaiming to the network devices that, “I am carrying traffic for the multicast application that
uses multicast group address 225.5.5.5; do you want it?” A multicast address is never assigned to
a network device, so it is never used as a source address. The source address on a multicast packet,
or any IP packet, should always be a unicast address.

=== Multicast Address Range and Structure

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has assigned class D IP addresses to multicast
applications. The first 4 bits of the first octet for a class D address are always 1110. IP multicast
addresses range from 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255. As these addresses are used to represent
multicast groups (applications) and not hosts, there is no need for a subnet mask for multicast
addresses because they are not hierarchical. In other words, there is only one requirement for a
multicast address: The first 4 bits of the first octet must be 1110. The last 28 bits are unstructured.

|====
Multicast Address :  Range Usage
224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255:  This range represents the entire IPv4 multicast address space. It is reserved for multicast applications.
224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.255 : permanent groups; Addresses from this range are assigned by IANA for network protocols on a local segment. Routers do not forward packets with destination addresses used from this range.
224.0.1.0 to 224.0.1.255 : permanent groups; Addresses from this range are assigned by IANA for the network protocols that are forwarded in the entire network. Routers forward packets with destination addresses used from this range.
232.0.0.0 to 232.255.255.255:  This range is used for SSM applications.
233.0.0.0 to 233.255.255.255 : This range is called the GLOP addressing. It is used for automatically allocating 256 multicast addresses to any enterprise that owns a registered ASN.
239.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 : This range is used for private multicast domains. These addresses are called administratively scoped addresses.
Remaining ranges of addresses : transient groups; Any enterprise can allocate a multicast address from the transient groups for a global multicast application and should release it when the application is no longer in use.

=== Mapping IP multicast address to MAC addresses

ip -> mac address = (0x01005E) + 0 bit + last 23 bits of the IP address
